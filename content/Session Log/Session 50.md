# Gambit Accepted
## Airship Preparations
- [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) saves 8 [Yvernus](../Locations/Areas/Yvernus%20District.md) civilians using his Lesser Restoration spell.
- [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md), [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) and [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) plan to return back to [Ironfleet Compound](../Locations/Buildings/Ironfleet%20Compound.md). As they pass by the library, they see [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md) researching.
- The librarian catches a glimpse of [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) and [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md), and she asks them to return the abjuration tome for [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md)'s bow. [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) returns the tome and [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) receives the bow.
- [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) remembers losing her violin that was gifted to her by her adoptive parents. She also remembered her parents' deaths.
- [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md), [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) and [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) return to the [Ironfleet Compound](../Locations/Buildings/Ironfleet%20Compound.md) on their steeds.
- Back at the [Ironfleet Compound](../Locations/Buildings/Ironfleet%20Compound.md), the three reports back what transpired in [Ankyra's Old Castle Compound](../Locations/Buildings/Ankyra's%20Old%20Castle%20Compound.md).
- [Gandour](../../Gandour%20Ironfleet.md) and the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) decide to continue the trial run of the airship later in the afternoon. He asks the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) to suggest some names for the airship. To make things more interesting (and uplift the party's spirits), [Gandour](../../Gandour%20Ironfleet.md) holds a naming competition of the airship.
- [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) wins the competition. The airship is formally named as the [Bloated Dragon](../Items/Bloated%20Dragon.md).
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) inspects the [Bloated Dragon](../Items/Bloated%20Dragon.md)'s decks.
- Just as the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) is about to ride the [Bloated Dragon](../Items/Bloated%20Dragon.md), [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md) returns bearing a message from [Savras University](../Locations/Buildings/Savras%20University.md) about [Professor Embersense](../NPCs/Dorfir%20Embersense.md)'s location. [Professor Embersense](../NPCs/Dorfir%20Embersense.md) and his apprentice, [Fiamil](../NPCs/Fiamil%20Underwood.md), are currently researching an ancient structure resurfacing from the sea. [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md) suggests a destination to [Gandour](../../Gandour%20Ironfleet.md), and the latter accepts.
- For the test flight, the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) is accompanied by [Gandour](../../Gandour%20Ironfleet.md) and two engineers.
- The flight proves uneventful, which was good news to the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md). However, the [Bloated Dragon](../Items/Bloated%20Dragon.md) is slow.
## The Queen's Gambit
- Upon arriving at the destination, [Gandour](../../Gandour%20Ironfleet.md) and the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) could not find the ruins. [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md) uses a spyglass to check for ruins; he finds a shallow sandbar that they can land on.
- [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) sees an abnormal phenomenon: the seawater rising like a hill. The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) checks and sees that the hill is actually the roof of a marble structure. Upon investigating, [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) confirms that the magic must have been cast on the structure to hide it.
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) descends the fifteen-foot rise and comes to see the structure's doors. In front of it is an arena with 8x8 checkered squares. On it are broken chess pieces. The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) cannot enter the arena as it is enveloped by a magical force field.
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) reads the inscription on the door:
> THE QUEEN'S GAMBIT
>
> TO ENTER MY LIBRARY, YOU MUST FIRST DEFEAT ME
> 
> IN A BATTLE BETWEEN LIGHT AND DARK;
> 
> MY QUEEN WILL PLAY FOR THE LIGHT OF KNOWLEDGE,
> 
> AND YOUR KING SHOULD CHOOSE YOUR DARKENED KNIGHTS.
>
> LET YOUR KNIGHTS RETRIEVE THE DARKENED BLADES,
> 
> SO YOUR KING HAS A SWORD CROWN TO BEAR;
> 
> ONLY THEN YOU CAN ENTER THE SQUARED BATTLEFIELD
> 
> AND UNDERTAKE MY PRECARIOUS DARE.
>
> YOUR DEFEAT WILL YIELD DEMISE
> 
> SO YOUR KNIGHTS MUST PROFESS THEIR MIGHT.
> 
> IF YOU WIN, Iâ€™LL PERMIT YOU TO RISE,
> 
> AND THY DARKENED SOULS I WOULD ENLIGHT.
- Each member of the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) except [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) spots a Darkened Blade underneath the sands.
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) solves the puzzle and finds the Darkened Crown. [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) wears the Darkened crown.
- [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) enters the arena; other members of the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) can now enter as well.
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) defeats the queen piece and they solve the game. The ancient structure's doors open.
