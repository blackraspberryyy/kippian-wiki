# Beached
## Cold Autumn Nights
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) is stuck on the sandbar. The cold northern winds stop them from resting.
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) uses torches, rations, and arrows to create a bonfire. The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) uses a stabling mechanism from [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md)'s [Shield](../Items/Mythic%20Items/Vambrace%20Shields.md), ropes, and [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md)'s Immovable Rod to raise it from the rising seawater.
- [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) casts Animal Messenger to relay a message to [Gandour Ironfleet](../../Gandour%20Ironfleet.md).
- [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) casts Binding Ice to create a barrier from the seawater.
## An Enemy Anemone
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) wakes up to find three griffons circling the sandbar. Upon checking, they spot a [Giant Anemone](../../Giant%20Anemone.md) trying to eat a dead griffon.
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) is threatened by the [Giant Anemone](../../Giant%20Anemone.md). They successfully kill it, and they disperse the opportunistic griffons.
## Polymorphin' time
- [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) proposes to Polymorph [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) into a sperm whale. [Dorfir Embersense](../NPCs/Dorfir%20Embersense.md) and [Fiamil Underwood](../NPCs/Fiamil%20Underwood.md) excitedly agree.
- [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) casts Polymorph again to refresh its duration. The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) lands on the coast 10 miles from [Midkip](../Locations/Settlements/Midkip.md).
- [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) casts Polymorph on a thrilled [Dorfir Embersense](../NPCs/Dorfir%20Embersense.md). She turns him into a T-rex. [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md), [Fiamil](../NPCs/Fiamil%20Underwood.md) and [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md) ride on the polymorphed professor. [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) and [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) cast Find Steed. [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) and [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md) walks.
- Along the way, the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) spots the [Bloated Dragon](../Items/Bloated%20Dragon.md). They manage to catch its attention, thanks to a loud roar from [Dorfir Embersense](../NPCs/Dorfir%20Embersense.md).
- The [Bloated Dragon](../Items/Bloated%20Dragon.md) descends, and [Gandour Ironfleet](../../Gandour%20Ironfleet.md) meets them. He explains that the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) was gone for nearly two days. The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) concludes that entering the [Library](../Locations/Buildings/Sunken%20Library.md) must have induced another temporal anomaly.
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) notices that [Gandour](../../Gandour%20Ironfleet.md) is hiding something. [Gandour](../../Gandour%20Ironfleet.md), upon being questioned, tells the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) that they must not judge him. They ascend on the [Bloated Dragon](../Items/Bloated%20Dragon.md)'s lower deck and see [Janna Furwish](../NPCs/Janna%20Furwish.md) waiting for them.
