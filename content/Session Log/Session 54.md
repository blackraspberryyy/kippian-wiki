# In the Dead of Night
## A Bridge That Cannot Be Crossed
- As [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) and [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) are walking on the smog-covered bridge to [Drakon](../Locations/Areas/Drakon%20District.md), they see a hooded figure in front of them. The figure asks:
> *"Where's your friend?"*
- The smoke clears, and the figure is revealed to be [Kayriel](../../Kayriel%20Acquermann.md).
- [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) and [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) try to dissuade [Kayriel](../../Kayriel%20Acquermann.md) from attacking, but they fail. A group of hired thugs obstructs the path behind them. [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) and [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) attack [Kayriel](../../Kayriel%20Acquermann.md).
- [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) drops to zero hit points; [Nokia](../PCs/Companions/Nokia.md) turns into stone and falls from the sky, breaking upon impact. 
- [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) dies as [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) is too late to save her. [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) casts Dimension Door to escape the encounter with the dead body of [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md).
- [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) could not retrieve the [Aureate Rapier](../Items/Mythic%20Items/Aureate%20Rapier.md). The [Aureate Rapier](../Items/Mythic%20Items/Aureate%20Rapier.md) is now lost.
## Hit and Run
- [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) surveys the surroundings of [Ironfleet Compound](../Locations/Buildings/Ironfleet%20Compound.md). He perceives someone following him.
- [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) confronts the man following him. It turns out to be [Kayriel](../../Kayriel%20Acquermann.md). [Kayriel](../../Kayriel%20Acquermann.md) asks,
> *"Where is she?"*
- [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) attacks [Kayriel](../../Kayriel%20Acquermann.md). After a brief but deadly scuffle, [Kayriel](../../Kayriel%20Acquermann.md) comes out with a significant advantage. [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) manages to escape to the [Ironfleet Compound](../Locations/Buildings/Ironfleet%20Compound.md).
## A Sacrifice to an Oath
- [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) attacks [Kayriel](../../Kayriel%20Acquermann.md). [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) lands several blows to [Kayriel](../../Kayriel%20Acquermann.md). [Kayriel](../../Kayriel%20Acquermann.md) manages to hit back.
> *"At least you let me hit you."*
- [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) punches [Kayriel](../../Kayriel%20Acquermann.md), leaving him unconscious. [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) surveys the arena and sees eight individuals, who she is sure to be [Followers of Yekora](../Factions/Followers%20of%20Yekora.md), emerge from the shadows. They point their crossbows at [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) and [Kayriel](../../Kayriel%20Acquermann.md).
- At the last moment, [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) retrieves the [Evershift](../Items/Mythic%20Items/Evershift.md) and drives it into [Kayriel](../../Kayriel%20Acquermann.md)'s chest. [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) takes four hits from the incoming crossbow bolts. A scream from a woman reverberates within the arena.
> *"He's dead!"*
- The scream prompts [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) to enter the arena.
- [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) attempts to revive [Kayriel](../../Kayriel%20Acquermann.md) by casting a Revivify spell. [Kayriel](../../Kayriel%20Acquermann.md) opens his eyes and looks at [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md):
> *"Make my sacrifice worth it."*
- [Kayriel](../../Kayriel%20Acquermann.md) dies.
