# Scholarly Inquiries
## An Ancient [Library](../Locations/Buildings/Sunken%20Library.md)
- The ancient structure's doors opens to a small and narrow stone pathway. [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) determines that the structure is very old, and probably dates back from [Primordial Ages](../Lore/Eons%20and%20Ages/Primordial%20Ages.md).
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) enters and see a dated [Library](../Locations/Buildings/Sunken%20Library.md). The shelves are filled with scrolls, but they use primordial script.
- [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md) casts Comprehend Languages. Other members of the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) explore the [Library](../Locations/Buildings/Sunken%20Library.md).
- [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md) and [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) sees three stone pillars, each displaying a plaque containing a carved inscription. [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md) successfully translates the inscriptions by consulting her translation book for primordial language.
- Each inscription contains a riddle.
>Riddle 1: Unwelcome, difficult, precious, and rare. What am I? 
>
>Riddle 2: What should you add to a barrel of ale to make it lighter? What am I? 
>
>Riddle 3: I have rivers without water, forests without trees, mountains without stones, cities without houses. What am I?
- [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) and [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) checks the two spell circles on the stone floor. [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) sees that the sigils on the spell circles pertain to a certain conjuration spell.
- [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) and [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) investigates the statue on the northeastern part of the [Library](../Locations/Buildings/Sunken%20Library.md) that is surrounded by shelves. The statue depicts of a celestial defeating a devil-like entity. [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) thinks that the celestial creature resembles the Annatars they once met. The symbols on the devil are similar to those they saw when the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) encountered [Auriel Furwish](../NPCs/Auriel%20Furwish.md) in [Calyxius](../../Calyxius.md)' lair.
- [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) ascends the stairs to the second floor. He sees a makeshift camp. [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) checks it, and sees a foot-high pile of books written by [Dorfir Embersense](../NPCs/Dorfir%20Embersense.md). [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) also steals a pack of rations.
- [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) scours the second floor and sees two humanoids, a bearded old elf and a female human, resting on a table. After a brief confrontation, [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) determines that the two are [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md)'s colleagues: [Dorfir Embersense](../NPCs/Dorfir%20Embersense.md) and [Fiamil](../NPCs/Fiamil%20Underwood.md).
- [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md) reads a scroll that retells the major events that happened during the [Primordial Ages](../Lore/Eons%20and%20Ages/Primordial%20Ages.md).
## [Dorfir](../NPCs/Dorfir%20Embersense.md) and [Fiamil](../NPCs/Fiamil%20Underwood.md)
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) meets [Dorfir Embersense](../NPCs/Dorfir%20Embersense.md) and [Fiamil Underwood](../NPCs/Fiamil%20Underwood.md). The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) updates the two on what happened during the two weeks they are researching inside the [Library](../Locations/Buildings/Sunken%20Library.md).
- [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) asks [Dorfir Embersense](../NPCs/Dorfir%20Embersense.md) about a spell that could protect the [Bloated Dragon](../Items/Bloated%20Dragon.md) from magical attacks. [Dorfir Embersense](../NPCs/Dorfir%20Embersense.md) recalls that an artifact of sorts protects [Asteri District](../Locations/Areas/Asteri%20District.md). The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) informs him that the district is devastated during the [Assault on Asteri](../Lore/Events/Assault%20on%20Asteri%20and%20Unbinding%20of%20Yvernus.md).
- [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) asks [Dorfir Embersense](../NPCs/Dorfir%20Embersense.md) about [Feypeak](../Locations/Areas/Feypeak.md). [Dorfir Embersense](../NPCs/Dorfir%20Embersense.md) only recounts information that [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) already knows.
- During the party's conversation, [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md) and [Fiamil](../NPCs/Fiamil%20Underwood.md) wander off into the pillars. They suddenly disappear into a hole in the floor.
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) checks the pillars. The two riddles are now blank; only the third riddle remains.
- [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) solves the last riddle. A hole appears on the floor and the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) is sucked into it. [Dorfir](../NPCs/Dorfir%20Embersense.md) remains on the floor.
## Trial of the Sphinx
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) meets a decaying, seemingly undead sphinx. They see the unconscious bodies of [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md) and [Fiamil](../NPCs/Fiamil%20Underwood.md) on the ground.
- The sphinx asks each member of the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) to exchange their [Mythic Items](../../Mythic%20Items.md) for their freedom.
- [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) successfully offers only a piece of her [Aureate Rapier](../Items/Mythic%20Items/Aureate%20Rapier.md).
- [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) offers [Matunda's Mace](../Items/Mythic%20Items/Matunda's%20Mace.md) in exchange for the party's freedom, including [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md) and [Fiamil](../NPCs/Fiamil%20Underwood.md). The sphinx accepts the offer, but only frees him, [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md) and [Fiamil](../NPCs/Fiamil%20Underwood.md).
- Unwilling to give up their items, the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) fights the sphinx.
- During the fight, the sphinx teleports to the first floor and fatally wounds [Dorfir Embersense](../NPCs/Dorfir%20Embersense.md) and [Fiamil](../NPCs/Fiamil%20Underwood.md).
- [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) recovers [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md)'s [Matunda's Mace](../Items/Mythic%20Items/Matunda's%20Mace.md), along with a tiara and a hefty amount of gold.
- Backed into a corner, the sphinx collapses the structure. The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) attempts to escape.
- The party defeats the sphinx successfully and escapes the collapsing [Library](../Locations/Buildings/Sunken%20Library.md).
- [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) casts revivify on both [Dorfir Embersense](../NPCs/Dorfir%20Embersense.md) and [Fiamil Underwood](../NPCs/Fiamil%20Underwood.md). [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) uses the diamond from the tiara for one cast.
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) realizes that the [Bloated Dragon](../Items/Bloated%20Dragon.md) is nowhere to be found.
