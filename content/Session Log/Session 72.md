# Infiltration, Phase 2
## Bringing in the Assault Squad
- [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md), [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md) and [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) guard the three warmages as they cast teleportation circles.
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) rebuffs several dragon wyrmlings. The warmages finish their casting and a significant part of the [Wycroft Gladiators](../Factions/Wycroft%20Gladiators.md) emerge from the portals.
- An adult blue dragon emerges and threatens to attack the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md). However, it is distracted by an explosion generated by [Gloompowder Bags](../Items/Quest%20Items/Gloompowder%20Bags.md).
## To the [Acquermann Estate](../Locations/Buildings/Acquermann%20Estate.md)
- [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md), [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) and [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) travel with [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md), [Michaela](../NPCs/Michaela%20Randall.md), [Leneia](../NPCs/Leneia%20Yarumcy.md) and [Kariil](../../Kariil%20Acquermann.md) to the [Acquermann Estate](../Locations/Buildings/Acquermann%20Estate.md).
- During their travel, they learn that the glimmering lights from within the collapsed structures are dragon eggs. At one point, a gloompowder explosion allow them to sneak past into the [Acquermann Estate](../Locations/Buildings/Acquermann%20Estate.md).
- [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md) leads the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) into the [Wayraven Catacombs](../Locations/Buildings/Wayraven%20Catacombs.md).  [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md) tells the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) that the duel should be held here. [Leneia](../NPCs/Leneia%20Yarumcy.md) heals [Kariil](../../Kariil%20Acquermann.md), and [Michaela](../NPCs/Michaela%20Randall.md) gives him a shortsword. [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md) briefly explains the situation to [Kariil](../../Kariil%20Acquermann.md), and [Kariil](../../Kariil%20Acquermann.md) agrees to duel [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md).
- [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) prepares for the duel; [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) hands him the [Twilight Dagger](../Items/Mythic%20Items/Twilight%20Dagger.md). The [Twilight Dagger](../Items/Mythic%20Items/Twilight%20Dagger.md) beckons [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) to kill [Kariil](../../Kariil%20Acquermann.md).
### The Duel
- [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md) announces the duel between [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) and [Kariil](../../Kariil%20Acquermann.md). [Michaela](../NPCs/Michaela%20Randall.md) bears witness to the duel.
> *"Through the sacred rite once performed by [Yekora](../Deities/New%20Gods/Yekora.md) and [Aulephi](../Deities/New%20Gods/Aulephi.md), I, [Kirren Acquermann](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md), hereby commence the duel of [Kariil](../../Kariil%20Acquermann.md) and [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md)."*
> *"I, [Michaela Randall](../NPCs/Michaela%20Randall.md), a noble of [United Kippian](../Locations/Kingdoms/Kingdom%20of%20United%20Kippian.md), bear witness to this duel."*
- Just before [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) gets a hit in, [Kariil](../../Kariil%20Acquermann.md) utters a word to [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md), and then strikes himself with the shortsword.
> *"You will not have your honor, my traitorous brother. Mementus!"*
### [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) Recalls
- [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) remembers a fragment of his own past. He remembers being adopted by [Kariil](../../Kariil%20Acquermann.md)'s maternal figure, [Queen Zwenyr](../NPCs/Zwenyr%20Elthana.md).
- [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) recalls that [Moon](../NPCs/Moon.md) and [Vanayra](../../Vanayra%20Metorne.md) were also adopted by [Queen Zwenyr](../NPCs/Zwenyr%20Elthana.md). According to [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md)'s memories, [Queen Zwenyr](../NPCs/Zwenyr%20Elthana.md) orchestrated the deaths of [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md)'s adoptive parents.
- [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) recalls that he and [Moon](../NPCs/Moon.md) were sent to spy on the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md). To protect their identities, their memories were magically removed.
- [Kariil](../../Kariil%20Acquermann.md) dies; [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) and [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) mulls over reviving him, but [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md) forbade them as it would dishonor the duel.
- [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) feels power swelling from the [Twilight Dagger](../Items/Mythic%20Items/Twilight%20Dagger.md). He throws it to test its power; at a near-instant speed, the [Twilight Dagger](../Items/Mythic%20Items/Twilight%20Dagger.md) flies back to him.
## The [Wayraven Catacombs](../Locations/Buildings/Wayraven%20Catacombs.md)
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) decides to burn [Kariil](../../Kariil%20Acquermann.md)'s body with the [Fire of Akenatun](../../Fire%20of%20Akenatun.md). [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md) tells the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) that there is a source of [Fire of Akenatun](../../Fire%20of%20Akenatun.md) in one of the catacomb's lower chambers.
- [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md) pulls [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) aside. [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md) confesses that she was never offered the leadership of the[Wayravens](../Factions/Knights%20of%20the%20Wayraven.md); actually, [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md) was never accepted into the secret organization. [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md) hid this fact due to her resentment with her and [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md)'s father, but [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md) tells [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) that she now understands her path in life: to lead the people of [Yvernus](../Locations/Areas/Yvernus%20District.md).
- [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md) persuades [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) to test if he will be accepted by the [Wayravens](../Factions/Knights%20of%20the%20Wayraven.md). [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) agrees.
- [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md), [Michaela](../NPCs/Michaela%20Randall.md) and [Leneia](../NPCs/Leneia%20Yarumcy.md) exit the [Wayraven Catacombs](../Locations/Buildings/Wayraven%20Catacombs.md) to gather information on how to go to [Shadowfell](../Locations/Planes/Shadowfell.md). [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md), [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) and [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) descend into the lower sections of the [Wayraven Catacombs](../Locations/Buildings/Wayraven%20Catacombs.md). The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) bring [Kariil](../../Kariil%20Acquermann.md)'s body with them.
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) approaches the door to the lower chambers. An inscription above reads the following:
> LET RAVENS MOURN, LET SHADOWS PASS
- [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) opens the door by putting his family emblem onto the slot on the sealed door.
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) descends down the semicircular stone staircase. They find other emblems carved into the outer wall. They enter the lower chambers where the funeral rites were once conducted. A section of the exhaust tunnel has collapsed, blocking their access to the deeper section of the [Wayraven Catacombs](../Locations/Buildings/Wayraven%20Catacombs.md).
- The party spots a small room. They see a well filled with vaporous liquid. [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) realizes that the well channels magic. [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) serves as the conduit for the spell and he speaks with the dead.
### Questions for the Dead
- Where is the [Fire of Akenatun](../../Fire%20of%20Akenatun.md)?
	> *"Guarded by the shadows of the [Wayravens](../Factions/Knights%20of%20the%20Wayraven.md)."*
- Who are you?
	> *"We walk the path of the darkness to lead the world unto the light of [Akenatun](../Deities/Old%20Gods/Akenatun.md)."*
- Will you guide us to the path of shadows?
	> *"[Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md), son of [Kristofer](../../Kristofer%20Acquermann.md), you are invited to walk the path of shadows."*
- Where is [Kristofer](../../Kristofer%20Acquermann.md)?
	> *"[Kristofer](../../Kristofer%20Acquermann.md) is leading the [Wayravens](../Factions/Knights%20of%20the%20Wayraven.md) from the shadows."*
- How is soul of [Kariil](../../Kariil%20Acquermann.md)?
	> *"The soul of [Kariil](../../Kariil%20Acquermann.md) has not walked the path towards [Matunda](../Deities/Old%20Gods/Matunda.md)."*
### The Path of the [Wayravens](../Factions/Knights%20of%20the%20Wayraven.md)
- After asking five questions, the well's magic dissipates. [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) sees a locket inside the well. [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) tries to take it, but instead he is transported into a place enveloped with magical darkness.
- [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) sees a vision of his ancestor being blessed by a divine light. The vision lights the room, and [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) sees a stone altar on the far end of the room. On the altar are two unlit candles.
- Disembodied voices talk to [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md):
> *"[Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md), present your emblem. You who have eyes that pierce the darkness, are you prepared to see the light?"*
- [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) agrees, and the voices respond:
 > *"Light the candles with the fire that blessed us."*
- A secret entryway opened behind [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md). [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) walks through it and he arrives at the room containing a brazier. On the brazier is a waning fire. Near the brazier is an inscription that reads the following:
> THE BRIGHTEST FIRE SUMMONS THE TALLEST SHADOWS
- [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) lights a nearby torch and brings it to the room. He lights the two candles and the voices speak to him.
> *"You who have provided the fire, are you willing to sacrifice your light and embrace the darkness?"* 
- [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) agrees. The voices induct [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) into the [Knights of the Wayraven](../Factions/Knights%20of%20the%20Wayraven.md).
> *"[Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md), son of [Kristofer](../../Kristofer%20Acquermann.md), you are now a [Knight of the Wayraven](../Factions/Knights%20of%20the%20Wayraven.md). Walk the path of darkness, and lead the world unto the light of [Akenatun](../Deities/Old%20Gods/Akenatun.md)."*
- A locket appears between the two candles. [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) picks it up and senses arcane energy emanating from it. [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) places his family emblem and [Shadow Sigil](../../Shadow%20Sigil.md) inside the [Wayraven Locket](../Items/Wayraven%20Locket.md).
### [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) and [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md)
- [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) and [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) attempts to dig through the collapsed ceiling. [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) casts stone shape on a large boulder to bore a tunnel through it.
- [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) and [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) descend down and meet [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) who was just exiting the room he was in. [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) tells them that he has found the [Fire of Akenatun](../../Fire%20of%20Akenatun.md).
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) climbs through the makeshift tunnel. The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) burns [Kariil](../../Kariil%20Acquermann.md)'s body with the [Fire of Akenatun](../../Fire%20of%20Akenatun.md).
### Treasure Room
- As the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) ascends through the semicircular tunnel, [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) and [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) spots an engraved circular slot on the wall. [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) removes the [Shadow Sigil](../../Shadow%20Sigil.md) from the [Wayraven Locket](../Items/Wayraven%20Locket.md) and places it on the slot.
- The secret door opens to a treasure room of the [Wayravens](../Factions/Knights%20of%20the%20Wayraven.md). They grab a blight spell scroll, an unidentified spell scroll, and a [Necklace of Prayer Beads](../Items/Necklace%20of%20Prayer%20Beads.md). The necklace contains one aquamarine, two black pearls, and two topazes.
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) exits the [Wayraven Catacombs](../Locations/Buildings/Wayraven%20Catacombs.md). They see [Leneia](../NPCs/Leneia%20Yarumcy.md), [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md) and [Michaela](../NPCs/Michaela%20Randall.md) running away from the biggest structure in the [Acquermann Estate](../Locations/Buildings/Acquermann%20Estate.md). Before the two groups have a chance to communicate, a black dragon emerges from the building and chases them. The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) exits the [Acquermann Estate](../Locations/Buildings/Acquermann%20Estate.md) and runs away from the dragon.
