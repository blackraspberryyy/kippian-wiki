- [Kirren](../../Kirren%20Acquermann.md) replies:
> "Don't worry."
- [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) casts Speak with Plants to talk to a flower belonging in a flower patch just outside the [compound](../Locations/Buildings/Ironfleet%20Compound.md).

## A Luminous Meeting
- Meeting with [Gandour](../../Gandour%20Ironfleet.md), [Nos](../../Nos-Aji.md), [Olrac](../../Olrac.md), [Dello](../../Dello%20Stoneshard.md), [Djorken](../../Djorken%20Veegar.md) and [Augustus](../../Augustus.md).
- [Mitarella](../../Mitarella%20Randall.md) tells [Gandour](../../Gandour%20Ironfleet.md) the news about the [Death of King Riordan](../Events/Calendar%20Events/Death%20of%20King%20Riordan.md).
- [Party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) shares details about the [Scepter of Akenatun](../../Scepter%20of%20Akenatun.md), including those who claimed it: [Elvin](../../Elvin%20Claymore.md) and [Rickard](../../Rickard%20Kyp.md); they could not identify the other one.
- [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) explains to [Gandour](../../Gandour%20Ironfleet.md) that she might be the reason why the [compound](../Locations/Buildings/Ironfleet%20Compound.md) was under attack by the [Dusk Talons](../Factions/Dusk%20Talons.md). [Gandour](../../Gandour%20Ironfleet.md) was understandably exasperated.
- [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md) sees a vision of [Agatha](../../Agatha.md). [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md) does not understand what [Agatha](../../Agatha.md) said.
- [Mitarella](../../Mitarella%20Randall.md) shares [Kayriel](../../Kayriel%20Acquermann.md)'s mission in [Sumber](../Locations/Continents/Sumber.md).
- [Kayriel](../../Kayriel%20Acquermann.md)'s task is to spy on the ruling factions of [Sumber](../Locations/Continents/Sumber.md).
- The reasoning behind [Kayriel](../../Kayriel%20Acquermann.md)'s assignment was due to reports of [Sumber](../Locations/Continents/Sumber.md)'s elite gearing for war.
- [Kayriel](../../Kayriel%20Acquermann.md) infiltrated the [Order of Yekora](../Factions/Followers%20of%20Yekora.md) and became [Frederick](../../Frederick%20Oberon.md)'s right-hand man. His cover name is [Candor](../../Kayriel%20Acquermann.md). [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) attests to this fact.
- [Kayriel](../../Kayriel%20Acquermann.md) was assigned for 25 years. Two years ago [Kayriel](../../Kayriel%20Acquermann.md) broke contact with [Mitarella](../../Mitarella%20Randall.md).
- [Mitarella](../../Mitarella%20Randall.md), [Kayvan](../../Kayvan%20Acquermann.md) and [Kirren](../../Kirren%20Acquermann.md) knows nothing about [Kayriel](../../Kayriel%20Acquermann.md)'s ability to magically create a clone of himself.
- [Kayvan](../../Kayvan%20Acquermann.md) shares that he has communication with his father. In addition, he exclaims that his father is loyal to his family and king.
> If I know anything about my father, it is that his loyalty lies first with his family, and then the king...
- [Kirren](../../Kirren%20Acquermann.md) backs up [Kayvan](../../Kayvan%20Acquermann.md), saying that [Kayriel](../../Kayriel%20Acquermann.md), even when afar, was trying to be her father figure.
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) is unsure about [Kayriel](../../Kayriel%20Acquermann.md)'s affiliation: is he a spy for [Kippian](../Locations/Kingdoms/Kingdom%20of%20United%20Kippian.md), a servant of [Frederick](../../Frederick%20Oberon.md), or a member of [The Cult of Miledu](../../The%20Cult%20of%20Miledu.md)?
- Stumped on the identity of the holder of the Acquermann ring they found in the [Theater Incident](../../Theater%20Incident.md), the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) recollects their thoughts.
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) excluded [Kayriel](../../Kayriel%20Acquermann.md) and [Korvin](../../Korvin%20Acquermann.md) as the Acquermann member of [The Cult of Miledu](../../The%20Cult%20of%20Miledu.md).
- [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) asks [Kirren](../../Kirren%20Acquermann.md) if the [Acquermann Clan](../../Acquermann%20Clan.md) has records they can check. [Kirren](../../Kirren%20Acquermann.md) says yes... but the records are in [Yvernus](../Locations/Areas/Yvernus%20District.md).
- [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) casts Disguise Self to mimic the face of the unknown member of the [Acquermann Clan](../../Acquermann%20Clan.md).
- [Mitarella](../../Mitarella%20Randall.md), [Kirren](../../Kirren%20Acquermann.md), and [Kayvan](../../Kayvan%20Acquermann.md) could not recognize the face. However, [Nos](../../Nos-Aji.md) and [Olrac](../../Olrac.md) shares that they have seen that face before.
- [Nos](../../Nos-Aji.md) explains that [Mayor Silvano](../../Silvo%20Silvano.md) once had an adopted brother. Nos says that the man stole from [Mayor Silvano](../../Silvo%20Silvano.md) and ran away. 
- Curiously, [Nos](../../Nos-Aji.md) and [Olrac](../../Olrac.md) cannot remember the man's name.
- [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) casts Detect Thoughts, but the two really forgot about the man's name.
- [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md) recalls that there is a spell that could modify the memory of a large group of people, but the modification must be extremely subtle. 
- [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md) further explains that such powerful enchantment can only be cast by an [Eladrin](../Factions/The%20Eladrin.md).
