# Bedeviled
## Post-Interrogation Quorum
- [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md) informs the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) about [Auriel](../NPCs/Auriel%20Furwish.md)'s whereabouts. She tells them that a man, fitting the description of [Auriel](../NPCs/Auriel%20Furwish.md), is spotted going in and out of the [Grand Cathedral](../Locations/Buildings/Grand%20Cathedral.md) in [Foenyx](../Locations/Areas/Foenyx%20District.md).
- [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) notices that [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md) is exhausted. He tells her to rest. [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md) worries about relying on the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md).
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) meets up with [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md), [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) and [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md). Enraged, [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) asks for an explanation from [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md). [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) dismisses her, claiming that he too does not know or remember what he, [Moon](../NPCs/Moon.md) and [Vanayra](../../Vanayra%20Metorne.md) did.
- [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) walks away from the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md). [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) follows [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md), and successfully persuades her to help the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) find [Auriel](../NPCs/Auriel%20Furwish.md). 
### [Bloated Dragon](../Items/Bloated%20Dragon.md) update
- [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md) and company successfully integrated the [Emerald of Protection Gem](../../Emerald%20of%20Protection%20Gem.md) into the [Bloated Dragon](../Items/Bloated%20Dragon.md). The magic gem casts a shell-like magical barrier that prevents magic from passing through the barrier.
## Visiting [Geraldt's store](../Locations/Buildings/Dratzel's%20Priestly%20Goods.md)
- After getting [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md) from the [Ironfleet Compound](../Locations/Buildings/Ironfleet%20Compound.md), the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) heads to [Foenyx](../Locations/Areas/Foenyx%20District.md).
- [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) stops by [Geraldt's store](../Locations/Buildings/Dratzel's%20Priestly%20Goods.md) and trades back his gold for the citrine gemstone. [Geraldt](../NPCs/Geraldt%20Dratzel.md) persuades [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) to inscribe the gem on a ring. [Geraldt](../NPCs/Geraldt%20Dratzel.md) tries to sell the three diamonds worth 300 gp each to [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md). [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) asks [Geraldt](../NPCs/Geraldt%20Dratzel.md) to wait.
- [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) exits the shop and goes to [Doe Nutt Lapidary Services](../Locations/Buildings/Doe%20Nutt%20Lapidary%20Services.md), a shop that cuts and inscribes gemstones to metal jewelry. He talks to [Doe Nutt](../NPCs/Doe%20Nutt.md), and asks for the citrine gem to be set on a ring. [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) receives a [Ring of Lightning Resistance](../../Ring%20of%20Lightning%20Resistance.md) and pays 100 gp for the service.
- [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) asks [Doe Nutt](../NPCs/Doe%20Nutt.md) to fashion a pair of earrings from her garnet gem. [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) pays [Doe Nutt](../NPCs/Doe%20Nutt.md) 120 gp and receives [Earrings of Fire Resistance](../../Earrings%20of%20Fire%20Resistance.md).
- [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md), [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md), [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) and [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) enter [Geraldt's store](../Locations/Buildings/Dratzel's%20Priestly%20Goods.md) store. They buy the three diamonds for 700 gp and a piece of the [Aureate Rapier](../Items/Mythic%20Items/Aureate%20Rapier.md).
## Into to the Catacombs
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) is stopped by two guards on the way to the [Grand Cathedral](../Locations/Buildings/Grand%20Cathedral.md). [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md) correctly assumes that the guards are from [Ankyra](../Locations/Areas/Ankyra%20District.md). The guards inform the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) that they have been expecting them.
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) enters the [Grand Cathedral](../Locations/Buildings/Grand%20Cathedral.md) and spots nothing amiss. [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) descends into the catacombs and immediately, the smell of sulfur assaults his senses. He uses his Divine Sense ability, but he senses nothing. 
- [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) and [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) see [Auriel](../NPCs/Auriel%20Furwish.md) on a spell circle casting a spell in front of a sarcophagus. [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) correctly surmises that the spell circle is for a summoning spell. The two push [Auriel](../NPCs/Auriel%20Furwish.md) away from the circle, and a combat ensues.
### Dealing with the Devil
- During the battle, a [Horned Devil](../../Horned%20Devil.md) emerges from the sarcophagus. [Auriel](../NPCs/Auriel%20Furwish.md) warns and taunts that the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) is too late: [Calyxius](../../Calyxius.md)'s Herald will arrive soon. The fiend warns the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md):
> *"I sense a forfeited soul!"*
- [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) casts Hold Person on [Auriel](../NPCs/Auriel%20Furwish.md), making him paralyzed for the whole fight. Other members of the party assault the [Horned Devil](../../Horned%20Devil.md).
- The [Horned Devil](../../Horned%20Devil.md) brings forth two [Chained Devils](../../Chained%20Devil.md). The [Chained Devils](../../Chained%20Devil.md) attempt to chain down both [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) and [Auriel](../NPCs/Auriel%20Furwish.md).
- The party defeats the [Horned Devil](../../Horned%20Devil.md) and successfully fends off its attempt to capture [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) and [Auriel](../NPCs/Auriel%20Furwish.md).
