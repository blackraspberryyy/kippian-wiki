# Fulfilling an Oath
## [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md)'s Survey
- [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) surveys the [Ironfleet Compound](../Locations/Areas/Ironfleet%20Compound.md) and found [Dusk Talons](../Factions/Dusk%20Talons.md) planning to assault it.
- [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) heard a booming sound; she investigates it and sees that it was the main gate of the compound destroyed.
- [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) sees [Gandour](../../Gandour%20Ironfleet.md) directing his men to guard the breached gate.
- [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) realizes that the breach is a distraction to weaken the compound's defenses at other points.
- While resting, [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) is attacked. It is revealed to be "Candor," [Frederick](../../Frederick%20Oberon.md)'s right hand man.
> *"Finally, I see you again, [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md)."*
## Inside the Carriage...
- Meanwhile, within the carriage, [Kayriel](../../Kayriel%20Acquermann.md)'s body melts.
> *"You really think it would be that easy?"*
- [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md) casts Locate Creature, and finds a similar creature near the [Ironfleet Compound](../Locations/Areas/Ironfleet%20Compound.md).
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md), minus [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md), rushes to the [compound](../Locations/Areas/Ironfleet%20Compound.md).
## The [Party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) Rescues [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md)...  
- There, they saw [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) surrendering to a man hidden behind the shadows.
- [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) rushes forwards and attempts to grab the man. [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) fails; however, she figures out that the man [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) is surrendering to is [Kayriel](../../Kayriel%20Acquermann.md), or at least resembles its face.
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) decides to confront [Kayriel](../../Kayriel%20Acquermann.md).
- [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) climbs the nearby structure and finds three [Dusk Talons](../Factions/Dusk%20Talons.md) overlooking the [Compound](../Locations/Areas/Ironfleet%20Compound.md).
- [Kayriel](../../Kayriel%20Acquermann.md) is defeated; however, it turns out that it is not the real body of [Kayriel](../../Kayriel%20Acquermann.md) either. The body melts again, as the illusion bids another warning.
> *"We shall meet again, [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md)."*
