- [Father Ignatius](../NPCs/Ignatius%20Lavell.md), a young and clean-shaven priest, converses with [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md). [Father Ignatius](../NPCs/Ignatius%20Lavell.md) addresses [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) as his superior.
- [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) asks for some help with [Nokia](../PCs/Companions/Nokia.md), but [Father Ignatius](../NPCs/Ignatius%20Lavell.md) cannot cast the Greater Restoration spell.

[Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) shares that [Stella Kari](../../Stella%20Kari.md) entrusted it to him before she dies. [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) remarks that he is unsure of the path he is taking.

- [Father Ignatius](../NPCs/Ignatius%20Lavell.md) cannot lessen [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md)'s worries, but he coaxes [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) to hold on to their faith.

- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) meets [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md). They enter the chapel, which turns out to be the [Chapel of Amlin](../Locations/Buildings/Chapel%20of%20Amlin.md).

- [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) asks [Father Drenn](../NPCs/Drenn%20Halyx.md) to heal [Nokia](../PCs/Companions/Nokia.md)'s petrification. [Father Drenn](../NPCs/Drenn%20Halyx.md) obliges, but only if they pay for the service, the cost of which is 110 gp. The 100 gp is for the diamond dust to be consumed by the spell.

- Back in [Ironfleet Compound](../Locations/Buildings/Ironfleet%20Compound.md), [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md), [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) and [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) wake up and find the other members of their [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) gone.
- They check up on [Gandour](../../Gandour%20Ironfleet.md) who is deconstructing the warehouse to allow the airship to fly out of it.
- [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md), [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) and [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) see movement on the floating [Yvernus](../Locations/Areas/Yvernus%20District.md). They see a dragon fly out of it, and descend down into [Ankyra](../Locations/Areas/Ankyra%20District.md).
- [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md) decides to check on the situation. [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md), [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md) and [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) decide to stay to defend the airship.
- In [Ankyra's Old Castle Compound](../Locations/Buildings/Ankyra's%20Old%20Castle%20Compound.md), [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md) sees a [Void Dragon](../../Void%20Dragon.md) swooping down to the compound. The dragon appears to carry a man. The dragon lands on the castle walls, and waits.
- [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md) sees [Mitarella](../../Mitarella%20Randall.md) and [Remus](../../Remus%20Kyp.md) exiting the castle to check on the situation. [Mitarella](../../Mitarella%20Randall.md) approaches the intruders. [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md) stays within earshot of the regent.
- The dragon descends down on the compound and lowers its head. The robed man, who is wielding a staff with a dragon emblem, approaches [Mitarella](../../Mitarella%20Randall.md).
- [Mitarella](../../Mitarella%20Randall.md) talks to the man. The man negotiates for the prisoners' release in exchange for the lives of the civilians of [Yvernus](../Locations/Areas/Yvernus%20District.md). As a gesture of good will, the man casts a portal spell. Three civilians exit from the portal.
- [Mitarella](../../Mitarella%20Randall.md) heads back and consults with [Remus](../../Remus%20Kyp.md).
- [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md), [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md), [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) and [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) return to [Ironfleet Compound](../Locations/Buildings/Ironfleet%20Compound.md). [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md), [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) and [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) decide to go to check on the dragon appearing in [Ankyra's Old Castle Compound](../Locations/Buildings/Ankyra's%20Old%20Castle%20Compound.md).
- [Michaela](../../Michaela%20Randall.md) appears, and she votes not to exchange prisoners. [Mitarella](../../Mitarella%20Randall.md) is leaning to agree on the man's proposal. [Remus](../../Remus%20Kyp.md) remains undecided.
- The man approaches the building and warns the king to make a decision. He points his staff to the floating district, and a body falls from it.
- [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md) agrees with [Mitarella](../../Mitarella%20Randall.md). This pushes [Remus](../../Remus%20Kyp.md) to exchange their prisoners for the civilians of [Yvernus](../Locations/Areas/Yvernus%20District.md).
- [Mitarella](../../Mitarella%20Randall.md) returns to the man to negotiate: one prisoner for a third of the civilians.
- The man casts a portal and around 200 dazed civilians exit from it. The man asks for a prisoner. [Mitarella](../../Mitarella%20Randall.md) releases [Raveena](../NPCs/Raveena%20Malandar.md).
- [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md) soots [Raveena](../NPCs/Raveena%20Malandar.md) surprised about being saved. He hears [Raveena](../NPCs/Raveena%20Malandar.md) mention the man's name: [Elvin](../../Elvin%20Claymore.md).
- [Elvin](../../Elvin%20Claymore.md) releases another 200 civilians. [Mitarella](../../Mitarella%20Randall.md) hugs [Malvin](../NPCs/Malvin%20Randall.md) before releasing him. [Malvin Randall](../NPCs/Malvin%20Randall.md) stands behind [Elvin](../../Elvin%20Claymore.md).
- [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md) appears in [Ankyra's Old Castle Compound](../Locations/Buildings/Ankyra's%20Old%20Castle%20Compound.md) and sees the civilians. She breaks down as she never thought that they could not save civilians of [Yvernus](../Locations/Areas/Yvernus%20District.md).
- [Elvin](../../Elvin%20Claymore.md) releases the last 200 civilians. [Mitarella](../../Mitarella%20Randall.md) releases [Rickard](../NPCs/Rickard%20Kyp.md). [Rickard](../NPCs/Rickard%20Kyp.md) mockingly spits at [Mitarella](../../Mitarella%20Randall.md)'s direction: 
> *"The royals of [Midkip](../Locations/Settlements/Midkip.md) do not negotiate."*
- [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md), [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) and [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) arrives at the [Ankyra's Old Castle Compound](../Locations/Buildings/Ankyra's%20Old%20Castle%20Compound.md). [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) helps the civilians. [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) approaches [Remus](../../Remus%20Kyp.md) and [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md), and [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) walks to [Mitarella](../../Mitarella%20Randall.md).
- [Elvin](../../Elvin%20Claymore.md) mocks [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md). He then casts Thaumaturgy to make his voice loud. He warns those in the compound: 
> *"I am the herald of doom, and your doom is at hand."*
- [Elvin](../../Elvin%20Claymore.md) casts a large portal in front of [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) and [Mitarella](../../Mitarella%20Randall.md). The two back off. [Raveena](../NPCs/Raveena%20Malandar.md), [Malvin](../NPCs/Malvin%20Randall.md) and [Rickard](../NPCs/Rickard%20Kyp.md) rush into the portal, but the dragon stops them. The dragon and [Elvin](../../Elvin%20Claymore.md) must enter first. 
- [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md) casts Arcane Eye and attempts to enter the portal with it. The dragon senses this, but [Elvin](../../Elvin%20Claymore.md) persuades the dragon not to worry about it as it poses no threat. [Elvin](../../Elvin%20Claymore.md) mocks the party. [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) is irate; sensing a provocation, [Mitarella](../../Mitarella%20Randall.md) coaxes [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md): 
> *"Let them have this day."*
- The portal grows large enough for the dragon to enter. [Elvin](../../Elvin%20Claymore.md) utters the following words to [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md): 
> *"We will meet again... But you will meet them no more!"*
- The dragon smashes the three prisoners with its claws, killing them instantly. [Elvin](../../Elvin%20Claymore.md) and the dragon enters the portal.
- [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) sees a figure jumping down from the wall. The figure turns out to be [Kayriel](../../Kayriel%20Acquermann.md); he is trying to enter the portal. He fires three bolts into the portal.
- Sensing an opening, [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) uses her Fey Step ability to support [Kayriel](../../Kayriel%20Acquermann.md). The two attempt to enter the diminishing portal. 
- [Kayriel](../../Kayriel%20Acquermann.md) and [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) fail to enter the portal. [Kayriel](../../Kayriel%20Acquermann.md) is caught by the portal and breaks down into water.
- [Mitarella](../../Mitarella%20Randall.md) breaks down, and [Remus](../../Remus%20Kyp.md) is horrified by what transpired.
