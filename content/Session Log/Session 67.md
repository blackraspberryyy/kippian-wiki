# At the Edge of War
## Fighting [Kariil Acquermann](../../Kariil%20Acquermann.md)
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) fights [Kariil](../../Kariil%20Acquermann.md). [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md) hits [Kariil](../../Kariil%20Acquermann.md) with two arrows, and his body drops. [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md) notices that [Kariil](../../Kariil%20Acquermann.md) change to that of a guard covered with illusion magic. [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) sees the dead guard, and realizes that it is the unconscious guard he saw in the alleyway earlier.
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) realizes that [Kariil](../../Kariil%20Acquermann.md) might be employing both enchantment and illusion magic. Meanwhile, [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) sees light glimmering from a nearby rooftop, similar to the one she saw earlier. She decides to investigate and leave the combat to the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md).
- Two more figures who appear like [Kariil](../../Kariil%20Acquermann.md) emerge and attack the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md). [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md) kills one with a fiery chromatic orb spell, and [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) knocks the other one unconscious.
- Three more individuals who look like [Kariil](../../Kariil%20Acquermann.md) appear and attack the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md). [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) ignores them and climbs up to the rooftop. She sees three [Followers of Yekora](../Factions/Followers%20of%20Yekora.md) on the rooftop, but they are not hostile to her.
- The [Followers of Yekora](../Factions/Followers%20of%20Yekora.md) fire crossbow bolts at the individuals disguised as [Kariil](../../Kariil%20Acquermann.md), killing most of them instantly.
- One of the disguised individuals runs and imparts the following words to the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) before taking a crossbow bolt from a [Follower of Yekora](../Factions/Followers%20of%20Yekora.md):
> *"There are unwanted visitors. We'll meet again."*
- [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) attempts to use his [Revivifying Card](../../Revivifying%20Card.md) on one of the dead bodies. He is stopped by [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md).
- [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md) casts a fireball to the [Followers of Yekora](../Factions/Followers%20of%20Yekora.md)'s location. The roof collapses, and the [Followers of Yekora](../Factions/Followers%20of%20Yekora.md) are subdued by [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) and the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md).  
### [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) confronts the [Followers of Yekora](../Factions/Followers%20of%20Yekora.md)
- The [Followers of Yekora](../Factions/Followers%20of%20Yekora.md) explain that they are helping her and her [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) against [The Cult of Miledu](../../The%20Cult%20of%20Miledu.md).
- [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) asks how will they help her. [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md) casts detect thoughts, and he sees a retinue of soldiers reaching [Midkip](../Locations/Settlements/Midkip.md). He shares this to [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) and the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md).
- [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) asks the [Followers of Yekora](../Factions/Followers%20of%20Yekora.md) what will happen after the battle. The [followers](../Factions/Followers%20of%20Yekora.md) respond that it is up to [Frederick Oberon](../../Frederick%20Oberon.md), their leader. [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) asks them if [Frederick Oberon](../../Frederick%20Oberon.md) will come to [Midkip](../Locations/Settlements/Midkip.md), but the [followers](../Factions/Followers%20of%20Yekora.md) do not know. 
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) lets them go, but [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) warns them not to face [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md).
## Personal Affairs
### Back to [Ironfleet Compound](../Locations/Buildings/Ironfleet%20Compound.md)
- [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md), [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) and [Leneia](../NPCs/Leneia%20Yarumcy.md) take care of the dead. They put them on a cart and plan to carry them to [Ironfleet Compound](../Locations/Buildings/Ironfleet%20Compound.md).
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) asks [Leneia](../NPCs/Leneia%20Yarumcy.md) about [Kariil](../../Kariil%20Acquermann.md) and demonology. [Leneia](../NPCs/Leneia%20Yarumcy.md) answers by telling the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) that [Stella](../NPCs/Stella%20Kari.md) warned her that necromancy and demonology are two practices that she should never touch. 
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) reach [Ironfleet Compound](../Locations/Buildings/Ironfleet%20Compound.md) and see a crowd gathering in front of the gate. The people notice the dead bodies on the cart, and a few of them recognize the dead.
- Before anyone in the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) could react, [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) stands up and talks to the crowd. She convinces them that the enemies did this. As a result, the people become fervent enough to volunteer and help the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md)'s cause.
### Praying in solitude
[Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) prays in solitude inside the chapel. She asks for clarity about the situation between her and the [Followers of Yekora](../Factions/Followers%20of%20Yekora.md).
### Taking care of the dead
- [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md), [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) and [Leneia](../NPCs/Leneia%20Yarumcy.md) help the friends and family of the deceased. They carry the body inside the chapel so they can mourn peacefully.
- After the wake, the bodies are burned outside the chapel.
### In search of forbidden knowledge
- [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) tries to search for information about [Calyxius](../../Calyxius.md), devils, and necromancy inside the library. Unfortunately, the library holds no answers for [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md)'s questions.
### Guilt---that familiar feeling
- [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md) enters the wake and tries to talk to one of the mourners. She realizes that the woman nearest to her is related to the guard she hit with her arrows earlier. She stays silent in guilt.
### Eyes on the enemy, part 1
- [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md) successfully attempts to cast locate creature targeting [Kariil](../../Kariil%20Acquermann.md). [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md) sees him traversing the border between [Chtapodhi](../Locations/Areas/Chtapodhi%20District.md) and [Ankyra](../Locations/Areas/Ankyra%20District.md).
- Afterwards, [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md) casts scrying on [Vanayra](../../Vanayra%20Metorne.md). He spies on her for quite some time. At the tail end of the spell's duration, [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md) sees [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) emerging from the staircase.
### A lone ship
- [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) exits the [Ironfleet Compound](../Locations/Buildings/Ironfleet%20Compound.md) to survey the surrounding area. He sees two interesting things: [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) traveling to [Ankyra](../Locations/Areas/Ankyra%20District.md) on a horse; and a lone ship docking to a nearby port. [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) decides to check the ship.
- [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) sees a fifty-people strong fighting force exiting the ship. He observes, and he identifies a tall, heavy-armored man giving orders to the soldiers. 
- [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) decides to surprise the leader by sneaking up on him. The leader appears unsurprised by [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md), as if he is expecting the surprise.
- [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) identifies himself as a servant of [Gandour](../../Gandour%20Ironfleet.md). The leader tells him:
> *"Then you can treat me as a friend. We're from [Sumber](../Locations/Continents/Sumber.md) and we're here to provide help."*
- The leader then introduces him and the soldiers as [Followers of Yekora](../Factions/Followers%20of%20Yekora.md). [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) sees the [followers](../Factions/Followers%20of%20Yekora.md) marching towards [Ankyra](../Locations/Areas/Ankyra%20District.md).
### [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) confronts [Vanayra](../../Vanayra%20Metorne.md)
- [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) travels to [Ankyra](../Locations/Areas/Ankyra%20District.md) alone to confront [Vanayra](../../Vanayra%20Metorne.md). [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) finds a horse and creates an ancient companion.
- [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) enters the prison and interrogates [Vanayra](../../Vanayra%20Metorne.md).

[Vanayra](../../Vanayra%20Metorne.md) laughs mockingly. [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) casts thunderclap to scare [Vanayra](../../Vanayra%20Metorne.md).
- [Vanayra](../../Vanayra%20Metorne.md) tells [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) that [Kariil](../../Kariil%20Acquermann.md) loaned power from [Calyxius](../../Calyxius.md). In addition, [Kariil](../../Kariil%20Acquermann.md) is the one who taught [Auriel](../NPCs/Auriel%20Furwish.md) about necromancy and [Calyxius](../../Calyxius.md).
- [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) asks [Vanayra](../../Vanayra%20Metorne.md) about [Kariil](../../Kariil%20Acquermann.md)'s reason in joining [The Cult of Miledu](../../The%20Cult%20of%20Miledu.md). [Vanayra](../../Vanayra%20Metorne.md) answers that [Kariil](../../Kariil%20Acquermann.md) wants to claim his inheritance from the [Acquermann Clan](../../Acquermann%20Clan.md). [Kariil](../../Kariil%20Acquermann.md) wants the power from being a Lordknight.
- [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) asks [Vanayra](../../Vanayra%20Metorne.md) why she killed her adoptive parents. [Vanayra](../../Vanayra%20Metorne.md) tells [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) that it was an order from the [Council of Corleus](../Factions/Council%20of%20Corleus.md). It was explained to [Vanayra](../../Vanayra%20Metorne.md) that the order should stop a coming war.
- [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) asks [Vanayra](../../Vanayra%20Metorne.md) if [Frederick Oberon](../../Frederick%20Oberon.md) is part of the [Council of Corleus](../Factions/Council%20of%20Corleus.md). [Vanayra](../../Vanayra%20Metorne.md) adds that the [Council](../Factions/Council%20of%20Corleus.md) and [Frederick Oberon](../../Frederick%20Oberon.md) do not see eye to eye.
- [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) asks [Vanayra](../../Vanayra%20Metorne.md) about her and [Kariil](../../Kariil%20Acquermann.md)'s relationship.
