# Revelations, Part 1
## Nighttime Rain
- [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) tries to investigate the letter to find out the location of the supposed meeting. [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) put the paper against the light of a campfire. A heavy downpour ruptures and dissolves the letter, and [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) barely has enough time to remember the sketched location. [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) only knows that it must be on the eastern side of [Midkip](../Locations/Settlements/Midkip.md), probably within [Duospathia](../Locations/Areas/Duospathia%20District.md) or [Ankyra](../Locations/Areas/Ankyra%20District.md).
- [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) and [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) discusses their plan tomorrow: go to [Duospathia](../Locations/Areas/Duospathia%20District.md) and retrace [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md)'s steps when she was captured by [Kayriel](../NPCs/Kayriel%20Acquermann.md).
- [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) asks [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) to teach him how to pray. [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) guides [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md), and the latter feels comfort from the activity.
- [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md) goes to the armory to restock arrows. She sees a line of [Wycroft Gladiators](../Factions/Wycroft%20Gladiators.md) claiming supplies from the armorer. [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md) falls in line, but as she nears her turn, the armorer announces that the armory is depleted of ammunition and supplies.
- [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md), [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) and [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md) notices that [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) has gone missing. [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) asks a guard to report to him once they see [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md).
- [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) asks [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md) what he is doing with the [Emerald of Protection](../../Emerald%20of%20Protection%20Gem.md). [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md) theorizes that the [Emerald of Protection Gem](../../Emerald%20of%20Protection%20Gem.md) and the [Ymerald Staff](../Items/Mythic%20Items/Ymerald%20Staff.md) must have come from the same source.
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) takes a long rest.
## New Day (14th of Zagi)
### On [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md)'s Acquermann Sigil
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) wakes up. [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md) is already gone, leaving a note that he is helping imbue the [Bloated Dragon](../Items/Bloated%20Dragon.md) with the [Emerald of Protection Gem](../../Emerald%20of%20Protection%20Gem.md). [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) has not returned.
- [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) casts Legend Lore on [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md)'s Acquermann sigil. [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) sees the sigil being passed down through the Acquermann lineage. The last image she sees is the furthest from present time, where a sun-like entity hands the sigil. She hears a voice:
> *"He who bears the sigil of Acquermann must travel the darkened path to serve the light."*
### Resupply
- By [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md)'s request, the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) goes to buy some ammunition, armor and other exploration supplies in [Duospathia](../Locations/Areas/Duospathia%20District.md).
- [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) divides the 5000 gp reward they received from [Gandour](../../Gandour%20Ironfleet.md) last week. She keeps the gold of [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) and [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md) for the meantime.
- [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) buys a scrying orb worth 1000 gp.
### A Hideout
- [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) and [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) scope out the location where [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) was last abducted. Other members of the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) rest in an opening tavern.
- [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) finds a member of the [Order of Yekora](../Factions/Followers%20of%20Yekora.md) who was in the arena when [Kayriel](../NPCs/Kayriel%20Acquermann.md) died. [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) and [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) inform the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md), and they decide to stalk the man.
- [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md) follows the man in a stealthy manner. [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md) loses the man near a stone bridge over a river tributary. [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md) investigates the riverbank and finds a 4-foot high cave opening.
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) travels to the area above the opening. [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) casts Arcane Eye to scope out the cave opening. The cave opening leads to a waterlogged chamber which harbors a hideout.
