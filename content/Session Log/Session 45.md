> 
> -C/K
- [Djorken](../../Djorken%20Veegar.md) tells the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) that he received the letter from a guard.
- [Djorken](../../Djorken%20Veegar.md) imparts that [Mitarella](../../Mitarella%20Randall.md), [Remus](../../Remus%20Kyp.md) and [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md) will return back to [Ankyra's Old Castle Compound](../Locations/Buildings/Ankyra's%20Old%20Castle%20Compound.md) after lunch.

- [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) talks to [Kayvan](../../Kayvan%20Acquermann.md). [Kayvan](../../Kayvan%20Acquermann.md) tells [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) that he is positive that the handwriting is his father's, [Kayriel](../../Kayriel%20Acquermann.md).
- [Kayvan](../../Kayvan%20Acquermann.md) pleads [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) to accompany her. [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) hears this, and asks [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) if he could tag along.

## [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md)'s Meeting with [Kayriel](../../Kayriel%20Acquermann.md)
### A secretive meeting
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) prepares for [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md)'s excursion. [Kayvan](../../Kayvan%20Acquermann.md), [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) and [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) will observe the meeting.
- [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) casts Find Steed for [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md). [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) casts Enhance Ability on [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md).
- [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) travels on land alone. [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md), [Kayvan](../../Kayvan%20Acquermann.md) and [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) go to the designated location using the waterways.
- [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) could not find [Kayriel](../../Kayriel%20Acquermann.md). Hours go by and the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) waits.
- [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) finds a marking on the nearby wall. She remembers that it is a [Yekora's Spy Code](../../Yekora's%20Spy%20Code.md) utilized by the [Order of Yekora](../Factions/Followers%20of%20Yekora.md). She follows the trail.
- [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) enters a narrow alley that leads into a dead-end waterway.
- [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) finds a marked rowboat; she rides it and ends up at the edge of the river.
- Meanwhile, [Kayvan](../../Kayvan%20Acquermann.md), [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md), and [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) attempt to follow [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md), but to no avail. In the end, they go back to the [compound](../Locations/Buildings/Ironfleet%20Compound.md) to enlist the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md)'s help.
- [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) finds a guard ship marked with [Yekora](../Deities/New%20Gods/Yekora.md)'s code, ordering her to follow it. [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) ties her rowboat to it.
- [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) is led to a toll bridge connecting [Aetos](../Locations/Areas/Aetos%20District.md) and [Ankyra](../Locations/Areas/Ankyra%20District.md). She finds a marking that leads her to an alley flanked by rowhouses and a waterway canal.
- [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) meets [Kayriel](../../Kayriel%20Acquermann.md). [Kayriel](../../Kayriel%20Acquermann.md) persuades [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) to trust him. [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) detects that she is outnumbered; it is futile to resist [Kayriel](../../Kayriel%20Acquermann.md).
- [Kayriel](../../Kayriel%20Acquermann.md) hands [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) a black leather bag to cover her head. He reasons that he needs to keep his hideout unknown. Two assassins hold and guide [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) to his hideout.
- Upon arriving at the underground hideout, [Kayriel](../../Kayriel%20Acquermann.md) asks [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) to doff her armor and entrust him her possessions. [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) implores to keep [Aulephi](../Deities/New%20Gods/Aulephi.md)'s amulet; [Kayriel](../../Kayriel%20Acquermann.md) obliges.
- [Kayriel](../../Kayriel%20Acquermann.md) leads [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) to an adjacent room fitted with a dining table.
### On [Kayriel](../../Kayriel%20Acquermann.md)'s loyalty
- [Kayriel](../../Kayriel%20Acquermann.md) asks [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) what she knows about him; [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) replies with what she knows: that [Kayriel](../../Kayriel%20Acquermann.md) is a spy for [Kippian](../Locations/Kingdoms/Kingdom%20of%20United%20Kippian.md) who is working for [Frederick](../../Frederick%20Oberon.md). [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) also implicates him as having ties with [The Cult of Miledu](../../The%20Cult%20of%20Miledu.md).
- [Kayriel](../../Kayriel%20Acquermann.md) explains that he is still loyal to [Kippian](../Locations/Kingdoms/Kingdom%20of%20United%20Kippian.md). However, he needs to complete his mission as a spy. This, he hopes, should explain for his actions.
- According to [Kayriel](../../Kayriel%20Acquermann.md), [Frederick](../../Frederick%20Oberon.md) assigned him to take [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) back to [Sumber](../Locations/Continents/Sumber.md). [Kayriel](../../Kayriel%20Acquermann.md), upon hearing [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md)'s story, is not inclined to follow the order.
- [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) asks if it is safe to tell all this with the [Dusk Talon](../Factions/Dusk%20Talons.md) assassins hearing them. [Kayriel](../../Kayriel%20Acquermann.md) replies that the [Dusk Talons](../Factions/Dusk%20Talons.md)' loyalty lies with him, and not the [Order of Yekora](../Factions/Followers%20of%20Yekora.md).
### [Kayriel](../../Kayriel%20Acquermann.md)'s plan
- [Kayriel](../../Kayriel%20Acquermann.md) shares his plan: in order to preserve his cover as a [Kippian](../Locations/Kingdoms/Kingdom%20of%20United%20Kippian.md) spy and earn [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md)'s trust, [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) must kill [Kayriel](../../Kayriel%20Acquermann.md) the next time they meet.
- [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) is initially hesitant, but [Kayriel](../../Kayriel%20Acquermann.md) convinces her to trust the plan. To ensure that it is him, [Kayriel](../../Kayriel%20Acquermann.md) shows [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) a locket with a picture of him, his wife, and [Kayvan](../../Kayvan%20Acquermann.md). He reveals that this is the thing he stole from his son's quarters in [Ankyra's Old Castle Compound](../Locations/Buildings/Ankyra's%20Old%20Castle%20Compound.md).
### Knowledge about [The Cult of Miledu](../../The%20Cult%20of%20Miledu.md)
- Regarding [The Cult of Miledu](../../The%20Cult%20of%20Miledu.md), [Kayriel](../../Kayriel%20Acquermann.md) is as clueless as the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md). He mentions that he has knowledge of the [Theater Incident](../../Theater%20Incident.md) since a follower from the [Order of Yekora](../Factions/Followers%20of%20Yekora.md) told it to him.
### On [Kayriel](../../Kayriel%20Acquermann.md)'s clones
- [Kayriel](../../Kayriel%20Acquermann.md)'s clones are the result of a magic cast by a [Sumber](../Locations/Continents/Sumber.md) mage on him. He does not know how many clones are left, though he thinks that there are about five. [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) shares that they have killed two of them.
### On the mysterious [Acquermann](../../Acquermann%20Clan.md)
- Two years ago, [Kayriel](../../Kayriel%20Acquermann.md) broke contact with [Kippian](../Locations/Kingdoms/Kingdom%20of%20United%20Kippian.md) to validate rumors of an individual using the [Acquermann](../../Acquermann%20Clan.md)'s name. He thought that it would lead him to his missing brothers, [Korvin](../../Korvin%20Acquermann.md) or [Kristofer](../../Kristofer%20Acquermann.md). The thread prompted him to go back to [Kippian](../Locations/Kingdoms/Kingdom%20of%20United%20Kippian.md) to search for clues. [Kayriel](../../Kayriel%20Acquermann.md) managed to do it as [Frederick](../../Frederick%20Oberon.md)'s right-hand man.
- [Kayriel](../../Kayriel%20Acquermann.md) gained information that the mysterious [Acquermann](../../Acquermann%20Clan.md) has an [Eladrin](../Factions/The%20Eladrin.md) companion.
- He lost the thread as he traversed the [Ephelus](../Locations/Kingdoms/Elven%20Kingdom%20of%20Ephelus.md) and [Kippian](../Locations/Kingdoms/Kingdom%20of%20United%20Kippian.md)'s borders. He sailed back to [Sumber](../Locations/Continents/Sumber.md), but upon arriving he is ordered by [Frederick](../../Frederick%20Oberon.md) to search and take [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md).
### [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md)'s return
- [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) recovers her possessions and exits the hideout the same way she entered it: with a bag on her head and with [Dusk Talon](../Factions/Dusk%20Talons.md) assassins guiding her.
- [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) meets the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) as they were about to find her.
