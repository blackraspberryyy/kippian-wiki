# The Plan Before the Storm
## [Leneia](../NPCs/Leneia%20Yarumcy.md)'s Apology
- [Leneia](../NPCs/Leneia%20Yarumcy.md) and [Laurie](../../Laurie%20Furwish.md) arrive in [Ankyra's Old Castle Compound](../Locations/Buildings/Ankyra's%20Old%20Castle%20Compound.md). [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) and [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md) meet them.
- [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md) apprehends [Leneia](../NPCs/Leneia%20Yarumcy.md) about her allegiance to [The Cult of Miledu](../../The%20Cult%20of%20Miledu.md). [Leneia](../NPCs/Leneia%20Yarumcy.md) apologizes to [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md). 
- [Leneia](../NPCs/Leneia%20Yarumcy.md) divulges that she freed [Roldan](../../Roldan%20Vinke.md). However, it was [Roldan](../../Roldan%20Vinke.md) who killed [Gokare](../NPCs/Gokare%20Veegar.md), [Shemance](../../Shemance%20Ironfleet.md) and [Armand](../NPCs/Armand%20Gorrel.md) in the catacombs of the [Grand Cathedral](../Locations/Buildings/Grand%20Cathedral.md). [Leneia](../NPCs/Leneia%20Yarumcy.md) claims that she was tempted by [Roldan](../../Roldan%20Vinke.md), and she was powerless to stop him. 
- [Leneia](../NPCs/Leneia%20Yarumcy.md) learned through [Roldan](../../Roldan%20Vinke.md) that she is the child of [King Riordan](../../Riordan%20Kyp.md) and [Janna Furwish](../NPCs/Janna%20Furwish.md).
- [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md) decides to lock up [Leneia](../NPCs/Leneia%20Yarumcy.md) and [Laurie](../../Laurie%20Furwish.md). [Leneia](../NPCs/Leneia%20Yarumcy.md) asks them about the dragon they saw earlier; she tells them that the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) needs help from the fight.
- As the captain of the guards are taking [Leneia](../NPCs/Leneia%20Yarumcy.md), [Leneia](../NPCs/Leneia%20Yarumcy.md) warns [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) about [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md). [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) ignores her.
- [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) heads out to follow the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md). He meets them just outside the [Ankyra's Old Castle Compound](../Locations/Buildings/Ankyra's%20Old%20Castle%20Compound.md).
- [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) and the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) talk about what happened to them. The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) decides to take a well-deserved rest.
## Back to [Chtapodhi](../Locations/Areas/Chtapodhi%20District.md)
- A servant of [Mitarella](../NPCs/Mitarella%20Randall.md) and [Remus](../NPCs/Remus%20Kyp.md) approaches the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md). He tells them that they are required by [Mitarella](../NPCs/Mitarella%20Randall.md).
- The servant leads them near the carriages, where [Mitarella](../NPCs/Mitarella%20Randall.md), [Remus](../NPCs/Remus%20Kyp.md), [Michaela](../NPCs/Michaela%20Randall.md) and [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md) are preparing to leave. [Mitarella](../NPCs/Mitarella%20Randall.md) asks the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) to go with them to [Ironfleet Compound](../Locations/Buildings/Ironfleet%20Compound.md). The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) rides a carriage.
- While inside the carriage, [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) takes a sip of the potion she bought earlier. This causes her to have a psychedelic trip. [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) resumes back to her normal state once they near [Ironfleet Compound](../Locations/Buildings/Ironfleet%20Compound.md).
- [Mitarella](../NPCs/Mitarella%20Randall.md), [Remus](../NPCs/Remus%20Kyp.md), [Michaela](../NPCs/Michaela%20Randall.md), [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md) and the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) beeline to the dining hall. Present inside the hall are [Gandour](../../Gandour%20Ironfleet.md), [Nos-Aji](../NPCs/Nos-Aji.md), [Olrac](../NPCs/Olrac.md), [Flavius](../../Flavius%20Underburrow.md), [Kayvan](../NPCs/Kayvan%20Acquermann.md), [Professor Embersense](../NPCs/Dorfir%20Embersense.md), [Professor Aufel](../NPCs/Aufel%20Fernquill.md), [Fiamil](../NPCs/Fiamil%20Underwood.md), and [Dello](../../Dello%20Stoneshard.md). The dining hall doors and windows are closed shut.
- [Mitarella](../NPCs/Mitarella%20Randall.md) reveals that the meeting is about planning the assault against [The Cult of Miledu](../../The%20Cult%20of%20Miledu.md).
## Planning the Offensive
### City-wide Evacuation
- [Mitarella](../NPCs/Mitarella%20Randall.md) shares that [Remus](../NPCs/Remus%20Kyp.md), [Michaela](../NPCs/Michaela%20Randall.md), [Kayvan](../NPCs/Kayvan%20Acquermann.md) and [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md) will lead the evacuation effort. The evacuation is to be scheduled one day before the assault.
### Assault on [Yvernus](../Locations/Areas/Yvernus%20District.md)
- The assault will be overseen by [Mitarella](../NPCs/Mitarella%20Randall.md).
- An offensive assault on [Yvernus](../Locations/Areas/Yvernus%20District.md) will be headed by the [Wycroft Gladiators](../Factions/Wycroft%20Gladiators.md). The [United Kippian Military](../Factions/United%20Kippian%20Military.md) will stay on the ground and act as a defensive force.
### Infiltration
- [Mitarella](../NPCs/Mitarella%20Randall.md) asks the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) to infiltrate [Yvernus](../Locations/Areas/Yvernus%20District.md) and defeat [The Cult of Miledu](../../The%20Cult%20of%20Miledu.md). The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) obliges.
- [Gandour](../../Gandour%20Ironfleet.md) will take the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) to [Yvernus](../Locations/Areas/Yvernus%20District.md) using the [Bloated Dragon](../Items/Quest%20Items/Bloated%20Dragon.md).
- [Severino](../NPCs/Severino%20Medlin.md), [Nos-Aji](../NPCs/Nos-Aji.md) and [Olrac](../NPCs/Olrac.md) will serve as distraction for the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md).
- [Michaela](../NPCs/Michaela%20Randall.md) and [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md) will serve as backup, if capable.
- [Professor Aufel](../NPCs/Aufel%20Fernquill.md), [Dello](../../Dello%20Stoneshard.md), [Professor Embersense](../NPCs/Dorfir%20Embersense.md), and [Fiamil](../NPCs/Fiamil%20Underwood.md) will provide intelligence support and assistance to the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md).
- To coordinate the assault, the scholars will use Telepathic Bond spell scrolls on the appointed persons.
#### On Prisoners
- [Mitarella](../NPCs/Mitarella%20Randall.md) asks the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) if they want to consider bringing some of the prisoners during their infiltration. The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) wants to interrogate [Leneia](../NPCs/Leneia%20Yarumcy.md) and [Janna](../NPCs/Janna%20Furwish.md) first before they decide on the matter.
### Timetable
- [Mitarella](../NPCs/Mitarella%20Randall.md) tells the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) that the assault will happen this week. The final day will be decided tomorrow (16th of [Zagi](../Lore/Mythical%20Heroes/Zerrus%20Zagi.md)).
## After the Meeting
### [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) evaluates the [Wycroft Gladiators](../Factions/Wycroft%20Gladiators.md)
- [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) talks to [Flavius](../../Flavius%20Underburrow.md) about the [Wycroft Gladiators](../Factions/Wycroft%20Gladiators.md)' readiness in the ensuing assault. [Flavius](../../Flavius%20Underburrow.md) assures him that the 500 gladiators under his command are itching for a fight.
### [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) seeks guidance
- [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) goes to the chapel to seek guidance from her patron, [Aulephi](../Deities/New%20Gods/Aulephi.md). [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) asks for forgiveness for the deeds she might do during the ensuing battle.
- Before leaving, [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) hears a familiar voice: 
> *Child, you cannot ask for forgiveness for a sin that you haven't done.*
### [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) and [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) ask [Mitarella](../NPCs/Mitarella%20Randall.md)
- [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) asks [Mitarella](../NPCs/Mitarella%20Randall.md) about his concern: the attack lacks prior intelligence. [Mitarella](../NPCs/Mitarella%20Randall.md) assures [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) that the surprise is enough to justify the attack.
- [Mitarella](../NPCs/Mitarella%20Randall.md) tells [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) that a flight of dragons will probably defend [Yvernus](../Locations/Areas/Yvernus%20District.md). [Mitarella](../NPCs/Mitarella%20Randall.md) is willing to sacrifice everything just so the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) can complete their task.
- [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) leaves and [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) approaches [Mitarella](../NPCs/Mitarella%20Randall.md). 
- [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) asks [Mitarella](../NPCs/Mitarella%20Randall.md) about the [Plane of Shadows](../Locations/Planes/Shadowfell.md). [Mitarella](../NPCs/Mitarella%20Randall.md) asks [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) back if he has consulted [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md). [Mitarella](../NPCs/Mitarella%20Randall.md) assures him that [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md) surely knows more than her. However, [Mitarella](../NPCs/Mitarella%20Randall.md) adds that the [Acquermann Clan](../../Acquermann%20Clan.md) gains its power from the [Plane of Shadows](../Locations/Planes/Shadowfell.md). This means that their power did not come from [Akenatun](../Deities/Old%20Gods/Akenatun.md); [The All-creator](../Deities/Old%20Gods/Akenatun.md) only appropriated it.
### [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) talks to the scholars
- [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) asks the scholars, minus [Fiamil](../NPCs/Fiamil%20Underwood.md), about teleportation into the [Plane of Shadows](../Locations/Planes/Shadowfell.md). The scholars say that they have not fully deciphered the sigils. That is mainly the reason why they want to accompany the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) during their infiltration.
- [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) asks about the teleportation circle inside the [Labyrinthus](../Locations/Areas/Labyrinthus.md). [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) suggests to use it as an evacuation camp. [Professor Embersense](../NPCs/Dorfir%20Embersense.md) says that there are many risks if civilians use it. However, it can hold a small number of individuals.
- [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) also asked about the portal to [Feywild](../Locations/Planes/Feywild.md). [Professor Embersense](../NPCs/Dorfir%20Embersense.md) mentions that the next portal opens on the 14th of [Spekid](../Lore/Mythical%20Heroes/Spekid%20Frostborn.md), during the [Winter Solstice](../Lore/Events/Winter%20Solstice.md). The portal's location in [Ephelus](../Locations/Kingdoms/Elven%20Kingdom%20of%20Ephelus.md) will be directly underneath the moon.
- As [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) leaves the scholars, she sees [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md) having a moment with [Fiamil](../NPCs/Fiamil%20Underwood.md).
