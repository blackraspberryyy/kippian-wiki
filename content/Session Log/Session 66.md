# The Darkness Dissipates
## Falling Unconscious
- [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md), [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md), [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md), [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md) and [Leneia](../NPCs/Leneia%20Yarumcy.md) exit the prison. Upon arriving on the surface, they notice several commotions from the people within the courtyard.
- The crowd seems to panic about people suddenly getting unconscious. The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) splits up to investigate.
### [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md)
- [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) approaches the [United Kippian Military](../Factions/United%20Kippian%20Military.md). He sees two soldiers of [United Kippian Military](../Factions/United%20Kippian%20Military.md) unconscious on the ground. A lieutenant oversees the commotion, and he talks to [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md).
- [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) observes that the unconscious guards have no wounds nor injuries. The two soldiers are carried to the nearby tent.
- [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) asks the lieutenant about the two soldiers' faith. The lieutenant tells him no, and [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) assumes that the soldiers were not faithful enough.
- [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) inspects the nearest vantage point near the area; he checks the nearby tower. [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) concludes that there is no way a mage could have casted a spell on the two soldiers from that area, considering that the area is thoroughly guarded.
- [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) goes to the survivors' camp to inform the others.
### [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) and [Leneia](../NPCs/Leneia%20Yarumcy.md)
- [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) and [Leneia](../NPCs/Leneia%20Yarumcy.md) approach the castle guards. The captain of the guards puts their concern to [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) about two unconscious guards.
- The unconscious guards have no wounds, injuries or even markings. [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) also learns that the people falling unconscious happen simultaneously.
- [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) observes if the guards are under magical effects. She is unsure; [Leneia](../NPCs/Leneia%20Yarumcy.md), on the other hand, tells [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) that what happened could be the effects of an enchantment spell. In addition, [Leneia](../NPCs/Leneia%20Yarumcy.md) also tells [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) that if that is the case, it can only be a powerful enchantment spell.
- [Leneia](../NPCs/Leneia%20Yarumcy.md), with [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md)'s approval, tries to cast dispel magic on one of the guards. [Leneia](../NPCs/Leneia%20Yarumcy.md) fails, but she is certain that the guards are under an enchantment spell. She tells [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) that a powerful restoration spell might alleviate the condition. 
- [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) and [Leneia](../NPCs/Leneia%20Yarumcy.md) search for [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md). They see him going to the survivors' camp.
### [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md) and [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md)
- [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md) and [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) approach the survivors camp from [Yvernus](../Locations/Areas/Yvernus%20District.md). The two see three unconscious bodies. [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) asks [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md) what happened.
- [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md) tells [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md) and [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) that the survivors suddenly became unconscious. The three exhibit no wounds or injuries. 
- [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) asks [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md) if tainted food could be the reason. [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md) replies that it should not be the case, since the other survivors are eating the same meals as that of the unconscious bodies.
- [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md) thinks that the reason could be an enchantment spell. [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) tells her that [Vanayra](../../Vanayra%20Metorne.md) was casting a spell. He asks if it is possible that [Vanayra](../../Vanayra%20Metorne.md) casted the enchantment spell on the survivors.
- [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md) replies that it is not probable, and tells him that usually, the targets of an enchantment spells should be close to the caster. However, it is more possible that the targets were subjected to an enchantment spell before, and that the spell was just triggered now.
- [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) tells [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md) that they will talk to [Vanayra](../../Vanayra%20Metorne.md) again. [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) and Noah see [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md), [Leneia](../NPCs/Leneia%20Yarumcy.md) and [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) going to the camp.
### Revisiting [Vanayra](../../Vanayra%20Metorne.md)
- [Leneia](../NPCs/Leneia%20Yarumcy.md) suggests that [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) cast a restoration spell on one of the survivors. [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) says that he needs 100 gp worth of diamond dust to cast a greater restoration spell. [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md) obliges, and she tells the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) that she will  procure the required spell component.
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) plans to talk to [Vanayra](../../Vanayra%20Metorne.md). Guarding the prison, they see the guard nearly falling unconscious. The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) give him food and water, and then ask him to rest as they reenter the prison.
- [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) casts silence on [Vanayra](../../Vanayra%20Metorne.md)'s cell, and [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) converses with [Vanayra](../../Vanayra%20Metorne.md) using his message spell:
> *"I know what you are doing."*
- [Vanayra](../../Vanayra%20Metorne.md) answers back:
> *"So what, can you stop it?"*
- [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) asks [Leneia](../NPCs/Leneia%20Yarumcy.md) about [Vanayra](../../Vanayra%20Metorne.md). [Leneia](../NPCs/Leneia%20Yarumcy.md) answers that she only knows that [Vanayra](../../Vanayra%20Metorne.md) is a member of [The Cult of Miledu](../../The%20Cult%20of%20Miledu.md), and that she works with [Kariil](../../Kariil%20Acquermann.md).
- [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md) inspects [Janna](../NPCs/Janna%20Furwish.md)'s cell to see if she can see the child who she thinks is [Auriel](../NPCs/Auriel%20Furwish.md). [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md) did not see anything amiss.
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) enters [Vanayra](../../Vanayra%20Metorne.md)'s cell. [Vanayra](../../Vanayra%20Metorne.md) attempts to fight back, but [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md)'s arrow hit her and [Vanayra](../../Vanayra%20Metorne.md) surrenders. The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) restrains [Vanayra](../../Vanayra%20Metorne.md) so that she cannot cast spells anymore.
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) exits the prison and warns the guard to take care when dealing with [Vanayra](../../Vanayra%20Metorne.md).
### Charmed, Not Unconscious
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) go back to the survivors camp. They see [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md), who hands [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) the diamond dust.
- [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) casts greater restoration on one of the unconscious survivors. The survivor immediately wakes up.
- The survivor tells them that she was not unconscious, but sort of acting to be unconscious. The survivor does not know what triggered the spell. The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) concludes that those who have fallen unconscious are charmed.
- [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md) asks an aide to procure diamond dust from [Foenyx](../Locations/Areas/Foenyx%20District.md) to cure the condition of the unconscious people.
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) leaves [Ankyra's Old Castle Compound](../Locations/Buildings/Ankyra's%20Old%20Castle%20Compound.md) and reports back to [Chtapodhi](../Locations/Areas/Chtapodhi%20District.md).
## Devil's Chains, Part Two
- As the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) is walking back to [Chtapodhi](../Locations/Areas/Chtapodhi%20District.md), [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md) feels someone tugging on her clothes. She looks around, and see the child near an alley. The child implores [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md) to enter the alley.
- [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md) tells the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) about the child. The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) enters the alley, and they see an unconscious man on the ground. [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) checks the man, and see that there are markings on the man's forehead.
- The skies darken, and a [Chained Devil](../../Chained%20Devil.md) attacks the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md). The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) rebuffs the devil.
- [Leneia](../NPCs/Leneia%20Yarumcy.md), who went unconscious during the encounter, was asked by the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) why did she fall unconscious. [Leneia](../NPCs/Leneia%20Yarumcy.md) do not remember falling unconscious.
- [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) carry the unconscious man and give him to a nearby guard. The guard shares that this is the second time that he received report of an individual falling unconscious. The first one, he says, was reported by a dwarf and an elf, who the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) recognize as [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) and [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md).
## Back Together
### [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) and [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md)
- [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) and [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) decide to follow the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md). On their way, [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) sends a letter to [Seris Goodman](../../Seris%20Goodman.md) and [Thorvald Goodman](../../Thorvald%20Goodman.md).
> [!note]  [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md)'s letter to his parents
> To my beloved mother [Seris](../../Seris%20Goodman.md), and my steadfast father [Thorvald](../../Thorvald%20Goodman.md),
> 
> I write this on the eve of war. The camp is loud with preparation, steel being checked, armor tightened, orders passed. It reminds me of nights back home when you, Father, sharpened your blade before a mission, and Mother lit the lanterns in prayer. I carry both of those memories with me now.
> 
> I want you to know I stand firm. My shield is steady, my oath unbroken, and my will as solid as the mountain stone that raised me. The companions I march with are brave folk, and together we will strike at [Miledu](../../Miledu.md) himself the one who poisoned [Kortusk](../Deities/New%20Gods/Kortusk.md), twisted our kin, and brought grief to countless dwarven halls.
>
> We have crossed paths with [Elix Claymore](../../Elix%20Claymore.md) twice now. He has changed twisted by [Miledu](../../Miledu.md)’s corruption. He did not hesitate to raise his hand against us, even against me. I admit this to you because you deserve the truth, not a softened tale. Yet still, something in me remembers the lad he once was. I do not know what the coming fight will demand of me… but I will face it with honor.
>
> If I fall, know this:
> I fall doing the work [Macchi](../Deities/Old%20Gods/Macchi.md) set before our line.
> I fall as a Goodman, as you raised me.
> I fall with steel in hand, not fear in my heart.
>
>Do not mourn me as though I was taken too soon. A warrior cannot choose when his final battle finds him only how he stands when it does. And I stand ready.
>
>But if the gods will it, and I return to [Onix](../Locations/Settlements/Onix.md) with victory at my back, then you may laugh at this letter and scold me for worrying over nothing. That would be a blessing.
>
>Whatever comes, I carry your teachings with me. Father, your discipline keeps my arm true. Mother, your faith keeps my path clear. If this letter reaches you, it is only because I wished you to hear my thoughts should I not come home soon.
>
>May [Macchi](../Deities/Old%20Gods/Macchi.md) guide my strike as he guided yours.
>
>[Thoradin Goodman](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md),
>
>Son of the Mountain,
>
>Shield-Bearer of [Macchi](../Deities/Old%20Gods/Macchi.md)
- [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) and [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) see the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) with [Leneia](../NPCs/Leneia%20Yarumcy.md). The two groups exchange information as they travel back to [Chtapodhi](../Locations/Areas/Chtapodhi%20District.md). 
### [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md) and [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md)
- [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md) helps the scholars scribe the telepathic mind spell on a scroll. He then takes a break, and meets [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md). The two decide to follow the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) to [Ankyra](../Locations/Areas/Ankyra%20District.md).
- During their walk, [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md) thinks there is something amiss with [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md). He asks [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) if there is something wrong, but [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) denies. [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md) notices that the markings on [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md)'s forehead briefly pulse.
## Devil's Chains, Part Three
- The two see the party in the distance. [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) tells [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md) to not follow her. [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) runs to the nearby plaza. She falls unconscious.
- The skies turn dark and a [Horned Devil](../../Horned%20Devil.md) and three [Chained Devils](../../Chained%20Devil.md) attempt to take [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md). The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) rushes to [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md)'s aid.
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) defeats the threat and saves [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md). [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) wakes up.
- The darkness dissipates, and they see a man wearing a white suit waiting in front of them. They see markings on his forehead similar to [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md). The individual seems familiar to the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md). The man speaks:
> *"I cannot believe that you've defeated the herald of [Calyxius](../../Calyxius.md) that easily..."*
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) realize that the man they are talking to is [Kariil](../../Kariil%20Acquermann.md). [Kariil](../../Kariil%20Acquermann.md) draws two rapiers, and attacks the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md).
