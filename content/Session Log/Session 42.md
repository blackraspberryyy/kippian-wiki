# Snap Back to Reality
## A Funeral
- [Party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) takes a long rest inside the [Labyrinthus](../Locations/Areas/Labyrinthus.md).
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) incurs temporal displacement sickness. [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md), [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) and [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) are more affected by the sickness.
- A servant informs them that they are invited at the [Funeral of King Riordan](../Lore/Events/Funeral%20of%20King%20Riordan.md). The servant gives them formal clothes to wear.
- [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) opts to meditate and talk to [Aulephi](../Deities/New%20Gods/Aulephi.md). [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) opts to rest instead.
- [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md) casts Augury with a couple of coins.
> [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md)'s Augury reveals: "Weal, maybe woe."
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md), except [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md), drinks a tea fashioned from the ginger where [The First Tree](../Locations/Areas/The%20First%20Tree.md) grew. It is a traditional drink honoring [Antasha](../Deities/Old%20Gods/Antasha.md), goddess of the land.
- During the traditional intermission, [Mitarella](../../Mitarella%20Randall.md) talks to [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md), [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md), and [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md).
- [Mitarella](../../Mitarella%20Randall.md) shares that [Kayriel Acquermann](../../Kayriel%20Acquermann.md) is not in [Sumber](../Locations/Continents/Sumber.md). She has had no success communicating with [Kayriel Acquermann](../../Kayriel%20Acquermann.md)
- [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md) overhears [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md) and [Michaela](../../Michaela%20Randall.md) talking. [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md) asks if [Michaela](../../Michaela%20Randall.md) if she knew about [Leneia](../../Leneia%20Yarumcy.md). [Michaela](../../Michaela%20Randall.md) denies it, and consoles [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md).
- [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) talks to the royal guards. During a friendly contest, [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) sees two runic inscriptions inside his [Vambrace Shields](../Items/Mythic%20Items/Vambrace%20Shields.md).
- [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md) spots [Professor Aufel](../../Aufel%20Fernquill.md) and talk to him. During their reunion, [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md) showed his professor his [Ymerald Staff](../Items/Mythic%20Items/Ymerald%20Staff.md).
- [Professor Aufel](../../Aufel%20Fernquill.md) inspects the staff, and is boggled by it. [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md) then shows the [Arcanus Labyrinthus](../../Arcanus%20Labyrinthus.md). [Professor Aufel](../../Aufel%20Fernquill.md) is understandably confused.
- [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md) overhears that [Professor Aufel](../../Aufel%20Fernquill.md) and [Michaela](../../Michaela%20Randall.md) talking. The [professor](../../Aufel%20Fernquill.md)'s there to conduct research within the [Ankyra's Old Castle Compound](../Locations/Buildings/Ankyra's%20Old%20Castle%20Compound.md)'s library that could help with the [Yvernus](../Locations/Areas/Yvernus%20District.md) situation.
- The body of [King Riordan](../../Riordan%20Kyp.md) is doused by the [Fire of Akenatun](../../Fire%20of%20Akenatun.md). The [funeral](../Lore/Events/Funeral%20of%20King%20Riordan.md) ends.
## In the mean time...
- [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) wakes up, and [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) is not in the room. She left the following note:
> [!NOTE]
> From [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md)
> I need to fulfill my oath.
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) plans a meeting with the group within the [Ironfleet Compound](../Locations/Buildings/Ironfleet%20Compound.md). The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) invites [Mitarella](../../Mitarella%20Randall.md), [Michaela](../../Michaela%20Randall.md), [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md), [Kayvan](../../Kayvan%20Acquermann.md) and [Remus](../../Remus%20Kyp.md).
- [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) prays to [Aisef](../Deities/New%20Gods/Aisef.md).
- [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) sneaks out of the [compound](../Locations/Buildings/Ankyra's%20Old%20Castle%20Compound.md) to sell some stuff. [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) stumbles upon a dagger with a [Sumberian](../Locations/Continents/Sumber.md) design.
- [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) asks [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) to read the inscriptions on his [Vambrace Shields](../Items/Mythic%20Items/Vambrace%20Shields.md).
> From [Wycroft](../Locations/Kingdoms/Wycroft%20Mountain%20Kingdom.md), To [Quigymara](../Locations/Areas/Quigymara.md).
- [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) asks [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md) about the [Shadow Sigil](../../Shadow%20Sigil.md). [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md) claims that she does not know about it other than that it looks familiar to the [Wayravens](../Factions/Knights%20of%20the%20Wayraven.md)' sigil.
- [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md) reads her translation book for primordial language. She became privy to the chronological succession of the [Primordial Ages](../Lore/Eons%20and%20Ages/Primordial%20Ages.md).
> The chronological list of the [Primordial Ages](../Lore/Eons%20and%20Ages/Primordial%20Ages.md):
> 
> [Age of the Old Gods](../Lore/Eons%20and%20Ages/Age%20of%20the%20Old%20Gods.md)
> 
> [Age of Dragons](../Lore/Eons%20and%20Ages/Age%20of%20Dragons.md)
> 
> [Age of Beasts](../Lore/Eons%20and%20Ages/Age%20of%20Beasts.md)
> 
> [Age of Orcs](../Lore/Eons%20and%20Ages/Age%20of%20Orcs.md)

[Professor Aufel](../../Aufel%20Fernquill.md) asks for a thorough inspection of the [Ymerald Staff](../Items/Mythic%20Items/Ymerald%20Staff.md) in exchange.
## Back to the Ironfleets...?
- As the [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md) steps out of the [Ankyra's Old Castle Compound](../Locations/Buildings/Ankyra's%20Old%20Castle%20Compound.md), the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) hears a whistle and the sound of detonation originating from the [Ironfleet Compound](../Locations/Buildings/Ironfleet%20Compound.md).
- [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) bursts into action and rides a steed. The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) rides a closed carriage pulled by two horses. [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) drives the carriage.
- During their frantic run, [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) is hit by a crossbow bolt. A hidden assailant attacks [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md), stopping the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) from their tracks.
- During the encounter, the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) determines that the assailant is [Kayriel Acquermann](../../Kayriel%20Acquermann.md).
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) traps [Kayriel](../../Kayriel%20Acquermann.md) inside the carriage.
