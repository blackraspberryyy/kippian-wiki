##### Exploring the Labyrinthus
###### After-combat visions
-  In a vision, Spekid Frostborn appears to [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md). 
 > The serious sorcerer evokes a mild chuckle, "I saw you beat my rival's successor. As a reward, I shall imbue you with the power of the Northern Frost."
 > Then, Spekid Frostborn draws the sigil of the Northern Frost on [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md)' forehead. He then doffs the [Frostborn Armor](../Items/Frostborn%20Armor.md).  
 > "But my power is still tethered to this extraplanar domain. To unlock it, you must defeat the construct that still wields remnants of me and Zerrus Zagi's power."
- [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) swaps his Shield spell to Rime's Binding Ice
- [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) wakes up with the [Frostborn Armor](../Items/Frostborn%20Armor.md) attached to him. But it only has 1 frost charge... and it is weighing [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) down---the armor does not attune to him.
- [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md) sees an apparition in front of her... 
>"As the new keeper of the [Evanescent Shortbow](../Items/Evanescent%20Shortbow.md), I shall help you on your journey." Amlaena Gustkil helps her aim the [Evanescent Shortbow](../Items/Evanescent%20Shortbow.md) into her bag.
- The ghost then touches [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md), allowing her to change her Arcane Shot ability(Beguiling to Enfeebling).
- [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) experiences the following vision:
>Adeena sees a familiar coin, while a voice whispers, "Dear child... Save those threatened by the fallen soldiers of Yekora. Judge the heathens as prescribed by your oath."
- [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) hears whispers of the dead:
> Absence of the cold releaseth sand, and creatures of leather.
- In a vision,[Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md)'s[Matunda's Mace](../Items/Matunda's%20Mace.md) glows,
> You see Astar, [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md)'s lost eagle, traveling to the moon, an ominous sign that your beloved pet is now resting in the afterlife.
- In a vision that shows the past, [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) sees Elvin Claymore in the dungeon, searching for something.
- Nokia, [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md)'s eagle, and companion, asks her to search the dungeon for a thing.
- [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md) is still experiencing a protracted vision... Other members of the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) left him to explore the dungeon.
###### Exploration

- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) encounters a dangerous, Extraplanar Mink.
- Before the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) defeats it, the mink burrows to recuperate.
