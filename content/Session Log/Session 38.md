# Exploring the [Labyrinthus](../Locations/Areas/Labyrinthus.md), part 4
## After-combat visions
-  In a vision, [Spekid Frostborn](../Lore/Mythical%20Heroes/Spekid%20Frostborn.md) appears to [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md). 
 > The serious sorcerer evokes a mild chuckle, 
 >
 > "I saw you beat my rival's successor. As a reward, I shall imbue you with the power of the Northern Frost."
 > 
 > Then, [Spekid](../Lore/Mythical%20Heroes/Spekid%20Frostborn.md) draws the sigil of the Northern Frost on [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md)' forehead. He then doffs the [Frostborn Armor](../Items/Mythic%20Items/Frostborn%20Armor.md).
 > 
 > "But my power is still tethered to this extraplanar domain. To unlock it, you must defeat the construct that still wields remnants of me and [Zerrus Zagi](../Lore/Mythical%20Heroes/Zerrus%20Zagi.md)'s power."
- [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) swaps his Shield spell to Rime's Binding Ice
- [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) wakes up with the [Frostborn Armor](../Items/Mythic%20Items/Frostborn%20Armor.md) attached to him. But it only has 1 frost charge... and it is weighing [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) down---the armor does not attune to him.
- [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md) sees an apparition in front of her... 
> [Amlaena](../Lore/Mythical%20Heroes/Amlaena%20Gustkil.md) trains [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md) to use the [Evanescent Shortbow](../Items/Mythic%20Items/Evanescent%20Shortbow.md).
>
> "As the new keeper of the [Evanescent Shortbow](../Items/Mythic%20Items/Evanescent%20Shortbow.md), I shall help you on your journey."
- The ghost then touches [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md), allowing her to change her Arcane Shot ability(Beguiling to Enfeebling).
- [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) experiences the following vision:
>[Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) sees a familiar coin, while a voice whispers, "Dear child... Save those threatened by the fallen soldiers of [Yekora](../Deities/New%20Gods/Yekora.md). Judge the heathens as prescribed by your oath."
- [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) hears whispers of the dead:
> Absence of the cold releaseth sand, and creatures of leather.
- In a vision,[Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md)'s[Matunda's Mace](../Items/Mythic%20Items/Matunda's%20Mace.md) glows,
> You see [Astar](../PCs/Companions/Astar.md), [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md)'s lost eagle, traveling to the moon, an ominous sign that your beloved pet is now resting in the afterlife.
- In a vision that shows the past, [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) sees [Elvin](../../Elvin%20Claymore.md) in the dungeon, searching for something.
- [Nokia](../PCs/Companions/Nokia.md), [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md)'s eagle, and companion, asks her to search the dungeon for a thing.
- [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md) is still experiencing a protracted vision... Other members of the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) left him to explore the dungeon.
## Exploration
- After inserting the tourmaline resistance gem, the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) is shown a vision of [Spekid Frostborn](../Lore/Mythical%20Heroes/Spekid%20Frostborn.md) during the war.

- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) encounters a dangerous, [Extraplanar Mink](../../Extraplanar%20Mink.md).
- Before the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) defeats it, the mink burrows to recuperate.
- During exploration, [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) sees a statue of [Zerrus Zagi](../Lore/Mythical%20Heroes/Zerrus%20Zagi.md). The inscription says, 
> The Mad Mage lived within a sand tower. Those who tried to scale it are burnt asunder.
- [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) and the party encounters a [Blacksand Elemental](../../Blacksand%20Elemental.md).
