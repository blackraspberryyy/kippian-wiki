- [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) talks to [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md). [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md) is fatigued as she and the people in [Ankyra](../Locations/Areas/Ankyra%20District.md) are helping the [Yvernus](../Locations/Areas/Yvernus%20District.md) survivors.
- [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md) asks [Michaela](../NPCs/Michaela%20Randall.md) to assist her in checking [Drakon](../Locations/Areas/Drakon%20District.md) later. [Michaela](../NPCs/Michaela%20Randall.md) refuses, reasoning that she is currently tied to her duty.

She heard that the chain must be located within the [Plane of Dragons](../Locations/Planes/Plane%20of%20Dragons.md).

[Janna](../NPCs/Janna%20Furwish.md) exposes that the [Kyp Clan](../../Kyp%20Clan.md) is weak, leaving only an unprepared prince to lead [United Kippian](../Locations/Kingdoms/Kingdom%20of%20United%20Kippian.md). [Janna](../NPCs/Janna%20Furwish.md) also criticizes the [Acquermann Clan](../../Acquermann%20Clan.md), saying that there is no present leader. She dismisses [Kayvan](../../Kayvan%20Acquermann.md), claiming that the child, in spite of his wisdom, is still inexperienced.

- [Kariil Acquermann](../../Kariil%20Acquermann.md) is supposed to be the son of [Korvin Acquermann](../../Korvin%20Acquermann.md). [Janna](../NPCs/Janna%20Furwish.md) claims that [Kariil Acquermann](../../Kariil%20Acquermann.md) presented [Laurie](../../Laurie%20Furwish.md) a sigil similar to what [Kristofer Acquermann](../../Kristofer%20Acquermann.md) gave to [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md).
- [Vanayra](../../Vanayra%20Metorne.md) is described as a beautiful [Eladrin](../Factions/The%20Eladrin.md) with blond hair. [Janna](../NPCs/Janna%20Furwish.md) seems to have a hard time remembering [Vanayra](../../Vanayra%20Metorne.md).
- [Remus](../NPCs/Remus%20Kyp.md) removes [Janna](../NPCs/Janna%20Furwish.md) from the room.

[Gandour](../../Gandour%20Ironfleet.md) provides [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) with incense worth 1250 gp.
