# Back in Action
## Consulting [Father Ignatius](../NPCs/Ignatius%20Lavell.md)
- [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) goes to the [Chapel of Aisef](../Locations/Buildings/Chapel%20of%20Aisef.md) to consult [Father Ignatius](../NPCs/Ignatius%20Lavell.md). [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) sees [Father Ignatius](../NPCs/Ignatius%20Lavell.md) preparing for a mass.
- [Father Ignatius](../NPCs/Ignatius%20Lavell.md) asks [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) to lead the mass. [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) delivers a sermon.
- [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) asks [Father Ignatius](../NPCs/Ignatius%20Lavell.md) about [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md)'s condition. [Father Ignatius](../NPCs/Ignatius%20Lavell.md) warns [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) that casting necromancy spells will have repercussions.
- After seeing [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) tired, [Father Ignatius](../NPCs/Ignatius%20Lavell.md) appeals to him to take a rest. [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) obliges, and takes a long rest.
- [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) wakes up at noon; [Father Ignatius](../NPCs/Ignatius%20Lavell.md) asks him to take his lunch as thanks for leading the mass earlier. [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) politely declines; [Father Ignatius](../NPCs/Ignatius%20Lavell.md) packs the lunch and gives it to [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md).
- [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) walks back to [Chtapodhi](../Locations/Areas/Chtapodhi%20District.md). He observes the district livelier, owing to the fact that the gladiators he drank with yesterday are here.
- [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) enters the [Ironfleet Compound](../Locations/Buildings/Ironfleet%20Compound.md) and sees the [Wycroft Gladiators](../Factions/Wycroft%20Gladiators.md) camp in the compound's courtyard. He sees the cafeteria brimming with commotion. He checks it, and sees the gladiators flocking [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md). [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) asks a gladiator about [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md), and the gladiator replies that [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) defeated [Severino](../NPCs/Severino%20Medlin.md), their champion.
## Discussion
- [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) calls [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md); [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) entertains the gladiator that [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) brought with him. [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) disperses the gladiators by buying them a barrel of ale. 
- [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) learns from [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) that [Kayriel](../NPCs/Kayriel%20Acquermann.md) is dead. He decides to pay his respects. [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) asks the other members of the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) to follow him and convene in the chapel. [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) initially declines, but is persuaded to come by [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md).
### [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) makes a promise
- [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) talks to [Kayvan](../NPCs/Kayvan%20Acquermann.md) and promises revenge. [Kayvan](../NPCs/Kayvan%20Acquermann.md) acknowledges [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md).
- [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) exits the chapel, but he meets [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) and the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) going to the chapel. [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) escorts the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) inside the chapel. [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) stays outside, and [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) accompanies her.
### [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) recalls
- [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) sees [Kayriel](../NPCs/Kayriel%20Acquermann.md)'s body laid on the altar. He is confused; [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) asks how [Kayriel](../NPCs/Kayriel%20Acquermann.md) died. [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) tells him that [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) killed him.
- [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) investigates and sees the wound on [Kayriel](../NPCs/Kayriel%20Acquermann.md)'s chest. He is sure that [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md)'s [Evershift](../Items/Mythic%20Items/Evershift.md) is the cause of the wound.
- [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) recalls a memory; first he remembers the moment he saw [Kayriel](../NPCs/Kayriel%20Acquermann.md) in [Kayvan](../NPCs/Kayvan%20Acquermann.md)'s room. Then, a distant memory presents itself to [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md): he sees a younger version of himself running in an urban setting. He does not know whether he is chasing something, or is being chased.
- [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) brandishes the [Twilight Dagger](../Items/Mythic%20Items/Twilight%20Dagger.md) and attempts to strike [Kayriel](../NPCs/Kayriel%20Acquermann.md). [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) stops [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) in time. He sits on the nearby pew.
- A voice calls to [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md), commanding him to slash [Kayriel](../NPCs/Kayriel%20Acquermann.md) with the [Twilight Dagger](../Items/Mythic%20Items/Twilight%20Dagger.md). [Kayriel](../NPCs/Kayriel%20Acquermann.md) refuses. 
- [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) interrogates [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md), and [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) explains that he became possessed.
- The serving acolyte enters the room and announces that [Kayriel](../NPCs/Kayriel%20Acquermann.md)'s body is ready to be doused with the [Fire of Akenatun](../../Fire%20of%20Akenatun.md) in one hour.
- During this time, the voice commanding [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) dies down. After a while, he checks his dagger's sheath. The [Twilight Dagger](../Items/Mythic%20Items/Twilight%20Dagger.md) is now replaced with a normal dagger.
### [Kayriel](../NPCs/Kayriel%20Acquermann.md)'s Cremation
- The body of [Kayriel](../NPCs/Kayriel%20Acquermann.md) is laid on a funeral pyre just outside the chapel. The acolyte produces a fire and blesses it. [Kayvan](../NPCs/Kayvan%20Acquermann.md) asks for the acolyte to let him do the rite. The acolyte follows, and [Kayvan](../NPCs/Kayvan%20Acquermann.md) places the torch on the funeral pyre.
- As [Kayriel](../NPCs/Kayriel%20Acquermann.md)'s body burns, [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) and [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) see two shadows pass by them. [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) feels her pocket, and draws the [Twilight Dagger](../Items/Mythic%20Items/Twilight%20Dagger.md). [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) sees that [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) is now wielding the [Twilight Dagger](../Items/Mythic%20Items/Twilight%20Dagger.md). The others seem to not notice them.
- After the ceremony, [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) call on the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) to talk together.
### Open Forum
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) members talk among themselves. [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) explains the reason why she killed [Kayriel](../NPCs/Kayriel%20Acquermann.md) to the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md).
- [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) shows the [Twilight Dagger](../Items/Mythic%20Items/Twilight%20Dagger.md) to the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) and asks [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) and the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) what to do with it. [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) casts Greater Restoration on [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) in order to unlink the dagger to her.
- The [Twilight Dagger](../Items/Mythic%20Items/Twilight%20Dagger.md) falls to the ground; it spins, rattles, then flies to [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md)'s direction. [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) catches it.
- [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md) convinces the party to retrieve the artifact in [Asteri](../Locations/Areas/Asteri%20District.md).
## Back in [Asteri](../Locations/Areas/Asteri%20District.md)
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) travels to [Asteri](../Locations/Areas/Asteri%20District.md). They are met by three royal guards guarding the breached wall.
- [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) bribes the three guards. They enter, and see the ruined [Asteri District](../Locations/Areas/Asteri%20District.md) in its entirety.
- [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md) casts a specialized Detect Magic spell. The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) follows [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md).
- As [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md) nears a rubble, an [Emerald Golem](../../Emerald%20Golem.md) attacks the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md). The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) confronts the golem.
- During the encounter, two [Greater Shadows](../../Greater%20Shadow.md) attack them. [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) manages to turn the shadow entities.
- [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md) learns that the artifact they are looking for is inside the golem. The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) defeats the [Emerald Golem](../../Emerald%20Golem.md). [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md) collects the [Emerald of Protection Gem](../../Emerald%20of%20Protection%20Gem.md).
## Brewing Trouble
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) is greeted by [Remus](../NPCs/Remus%20Kyp.md), [Mitarella](../NPCs/Mitarella%20Randall.md), and [Gandour](../../Gandour%20Ironfleet.md). They are reading a letter.
- [Remus](../NPCs/Remus%20Kyp.md) confronts [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md):
> *"When will you tell me that you've lost the [royal rapier](../Items/Mythic%20Items/Aureate%20Rapier.md)? I gave you my trust."*
- [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) explains that it was not her intention---it was inevitable because she died in combat. [Remus](../NPCs/Remus%20Kyp.md) forgives [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md), but hopes that [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) retrieve it.
- [Gandour](../../Gandour%20Ironfleet.md) gives the party the letter. [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) and the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) reads the letter.
> To [Remus](../NPCs/Remus%20Kyp.md),
> 
> We have your royal rapier. Give [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) to us and we'll return it.
