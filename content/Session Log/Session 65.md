# Children and Chains
## Long Rest (16th of Zagi)
- [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) stores the spirit shroud spell into the [Bloodstone Arcane Gem](../../Bloodstone%20Arcane%20Gem.md).
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) takes a long rest.
## Morning (16th of Zagi)
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) wakes up and see [Gandour](../../Gandour%20Ironfleet.md) meeting in the courtyard to personnel. [Gandour](../../Gandour%20Ironfleet.md) seems to instruct his personnel regarding the planned evacuation.
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) decides to travel to [Ankyra's Old Castle Compound](../Locations/Buildings/Ankyra's%20Old%20Castle%20Compound.md) to interrogate [Janna](../NPCs/Janna%20Furwish.md) and [Leneia](../NPCs/Leneia%20Yarumcy.md).
- [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md) informs the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) that he will stay in [Ironfleet Compound](../Locations/Buildings/Ironfleet%20Compound.md) to talk with the scholars.
- [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) opts to stay within the confines of [Ironfleet Compound](../Locations/Buildings/Ironfleet%20Compound.md). [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) asks [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) an object to remember her by. [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) gives him a chipped gold that from her [Aureate Rapier](../Items/Mythic%20Items/Aureate%20Rapier.md).
- [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) tries to approach [Gandour](../../Gandour%20Ironfleet.md), but he is too busy instructing his servants. [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) takes a step back; [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) asks [Anna](../NPCs/Anna%20Racquefort.md) to tell [Gandour](../../Gandour%20Ironfleet.md) where the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) is heading. 
## Getting Sidetracked
- As they are traveling to [Ankyra](../Locations/Areas/Ankyra%20District.md), the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) observe the houses being abandoned. They sense quiet panic from the residents. They spot a couple of civilians waiting for instructions on where to evacuate.
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) splits into two: [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md), [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md), [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md) and [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) head to [Ankyra](../Locations/Areas/Ankyra%20District.md), while [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) and [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) help the civilians.
### As the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) is traveling...
- [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) goes to a messaging post and sends a letter to [Elma](../../Elma%20Delcine.md), a housekeeper working at the [Effil Orphanage](../Locations/Buildings/Effil%20Orphanage.md). [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) encloses 5 gp in the letter. [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) pays 5 sp for the messaging service.
- During [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md)'s excursion, [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md) sees a child looking at her from a narrow pathway beside a nearby canal. [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md) ignores her.
- [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) sees a signaling glare from someone behind a chimney on the top of a two-story building. [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) points the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md)'s attention to it. [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md), [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) and [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md) partially see it; the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) decide to ignore it and head to [Ankyra](../Locations/Areas/Ankyra%20District.md).
### [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) and [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md)
- [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) and [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) find a guard to know the details of the evacuation. They find one entering a narrow alley adjacent to a canal. [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) follows the guard; the guard drops down suddenly. 
- [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) immediately hails [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md). When the two arrive at the guard's location, they see that the body is gone. 
- The two investigate, and they conclude that the body has been dragged onto a floating raft on the water. The two decide to follow the flow of the waterway.
- The two exits to a bridge and sees a guard. [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) asks the guard where to direct the evacuating civilians. He also asks him if he saw something flowing on the canal; the guard responded no. [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) and [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) explains the situation. The guard implores the two to file a missing persons report.
- The two continue to find the missing body of the unconscious guard.
## Interrogation
- [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md), [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md), [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) and [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md) enter [Old Castle](../Locations/Buildings/Ankyra's%20Old%20Castle%20Compound.md) and into the dungeons.
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) concocts a plan to interrogate [Janna](../NPCs/Janna%20Furwish.md) and [Leneia](../NPCs/Leneia%20Yarumcy.md).
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) walks by [Vanayra](../../Vanayra%20Metorne.md)'s cell, who appears to be chanting a spell. [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) casts the silence spell on [Vanayra](../../Vanayra%20Metorne.md). [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) targets [Vanayra](../../Vanayra%20Metorne.md) with a message spell:
> *"What spell are you casting?"*
- [Vanayra](../../Vanayra%20Metorne.md) replies:
> *"It wouldn't matter, you're just delaying things."*
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) heads to cell of the [Furwishes](../../Furwish%20Clan.md). Inside it is [Janna](../NPCs/Janna%20Furwish.md), [Leneia](../NPCs/Leneia%20Yarumcy.md), [Auriel](../NPCs/Auriel%20Furwish.md) and [Laurie](../../Laurie%20Furwish.md).
- [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) casts the bane spell on [Leneia](../NPCs/Leneia%20Yarumcy.md) and [Janna](../NPCs/Janna%20Furwish.md). Afterwards, he casts a zone of truth spell on the two.
- [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) asks [Janna](../NPCs/Janna%20Furwish.md):
> *"What are your intentions after we defeat [The Cult of Miledu](../../The%20Cult%20of%20Miledu.md)?"*
- [Janna](../NPCs/Janna%20Furwish.md) answers that she wants her freedom back. [Janna](../NPCs/Janna%20Furwish.md) does not respond further.
- [Leneia](../NPCs/Leneia%20Yarumcy.md) does not respond, but it is out of her being unsure what to do.
- [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) asks [Leneia](../NPCs/Leneia%20Yarumcy.md) how she and [Laurie](../../Laurie%20Furwish.md) escaped. [Leneia](../NPCs/Leneia%20Yarumcy.md) answers that it was just a lucky opportunity. [Leneia](../NPCs/Leneia%20Yarumcy.md) explains that she and [Laurie](../../Laurie%20Furwish.md) were within the [Plane of Dragons](../Locations/Planes/Plane%20of%20Dragons.md).
- [Janna](../NPCs/Janna%20Furwish.md) shares that [Elvin](../../Elvin%20Claymore.md), [Elix](../../Elix%20Claymore.md) and [Roldan](../../Roldan%20Vinke.md) are also within the [Plane of Dragons](../Locations/Planes/Plane%20of%20Dragons.md).
- As they were escaping, [Leneia](../NPCs/Leneia%20Yarumcy.md) saw an open portal appear in front of her. She took the chance and escaped.
- [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) asks how close [The Cult of Miledu](../../The%20Cult%20of%20Miledu.md) is in achieving its goal. [Leneia](../NPCs/Leneia%20Yarumcy.md) says she cannot say for certain, but there is progress. She adds that they are breaking the seal of [Miledu](../../Miledu.md).
- [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) asks [Leneia](../NPCs/Leneia%20Yarumcy.md) if she has been to [Yvernus](../Locations/Areas/Yvernus%20District.md) during the crisis. She answers no, and explains that [Elvin](../../Elvin%20Claymore.md) teleported them to the [Plane of Dragons](../Locations/Planes/Plane%20of%20Dragons.md).
- [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) asks [Leneia](../NPCs/Leneia%20Yarumcy.md) how to stop [The Cult of Miledu](../../The%20Cult%20of%20Miledu.md). [Leneia](../NPCs/Leneia%20Yarumcy.md) responds that they must stop breaking the seal of [Miledu](../../Miledu.md) within the [Plane of Dragons](../Locations/Planes/Plane%20of%20Dragons.md). [Leneia](../NPCs/Leneia%20Yarumcy.md) shares that they can access it by going to a temple in [Yvernus](../Locations/Areas/Yvernus%20District.md). [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) takes note of it, and realizes it is the [Temple of The Sealed Path](../Locations/Buildings/Temple%20of%20The%20Sealed%20Path.md) where they encountered [Theodore](../../Theodore%20Clayhollow.md) and [Elix](../../Elix%20Claymore.md).
- The four decide to huddle. During this time, [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md) notices the child she saw earlier hiding behind [Auriel](../NPCs/Auriel%20Furwish.md). She realizes that it is the soul of [Auriel](../NPCs/Auriel%20Furwish.md). [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md) decides to keep what she saw a secret.
- The four discuss whether to let either [Leneia](../NPCs/Leneia%20Yarumcy.md) or [Janna](../NPCs/Janna%20Furwish.md) with them on their assault. They decide to free [Leneia](../NPCs/Leneia%20Yarumcy.md) after a few more questions.
- [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) asks [Leneia](../NPCs/Leneia%20Yarumcy.md) if she knows who [Kariil](../../Kariil%20Acquermann.md) is. [Leneia](../NPCs/Leneia%20Yarumcy.md) responds yes; [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) interjects and asks [Leneia](../NPCs/Leneia%20Yarumcy.md) what his mission is. [Leneia](../NPCs/Leneia%20Yarumcy.md) claims that she does not know, only that [Kariil](../../Kariil%20Acquermann.md) is not present with the core of [The Cult of Miledu](../../The%20Cult%20of%20Miledu.md) during the crisis.
- [Leneia](../NPCs/Leneia%20Yarumcy.md) also shares that, if [Elvin](../../Elvin%20Claymore.md), [Elix](../../Elix%20Claymore.md) and [Roldan](../../Roldan%20Vinke.md) are to be believed, [Kariil](../../Kariil%20Acquermann.md) is playing a large role in furthering the goals of [The Cult of Miledu](../../The%20Cult%20of%20Miledu.md).
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) shares that they are planning to enter [Yvernus](../Locations/Areas/Yvernus%20District.md). [Janna](../NPCs/Janna%20Furwish.md) interjects:
> *"If you are bringing [Leneia](../NPCs/Leneia%20Yarumcy.md), you should bring me."*
- [Leneia](../NPCs/Leneia%20Yarumcy.md) tells the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) that she is willing to help them to repent for all the misdeeds that she has done.
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) frees [Leneia](../NPCs/Leneia%20Yarumcy.md). As they are walking by [Vanayra](../../Vanayra%20Metorne.md)'s cell, they observe hostility between the two. [Vanayra](../../Vanayra%20Metorne.md) shouts out to [Leneia](../NPCs/Leneia%20Yarumcy.md):
> *"You've shown your true colors, you traitor!"*
- [Vanayra](../../Vanayra%20Metorne.md) goads and taunts the party. [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) casts silence again; this enrages [Vanayra](../../Vanayra%20Metorne.md).
## Devil's Chains
- A girl appears to [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) and [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md). The child is asking the two to save her father.
- The two follow the girl into another pathway. [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) and [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) see a man unconscious on the ground. They investigate and see that the man has the same markings like what is on [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md)'s forehead. Then, the markings spread and cover the body. Furthermore, they see no bruises or wounds on the body.
- As [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) and [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) attempt to carry the body, they see the area around them darken, as if they were in a dream state similar to [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md)'s dream. The child and the body are still with them.
- [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) and [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) hear rattling chains. A [Chained Devil](../../Chained%20Devil.md) appears and attacks them.
- [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) and [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) successfully defeat the [Chained Devil](../../Chained%20Devil.md), and the surroundings turn to normal. [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) heals the unconscious man. The man gasps for air, but remain unconscious. 
- [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) and [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) carry the man and accompany the child to a soldier. The child appears to admire [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) more than [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md).
- [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) warns the child to not speak about what happened to them. [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md)'s assurance calms the child. The child introduces herself as [Lala](../NPCs/Lala.md).
