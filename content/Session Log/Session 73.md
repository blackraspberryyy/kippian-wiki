# Head-on Assault
## Gather Up!
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) gathers near the teleportation circles.
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) takes a brief rest. [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) dons her armor. The others recuperate. [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) gives [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md) the blight spell scroll and the unidentified spell scroll. [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md) casts identify on the spell scroll, and determines that the contact other plane spell is scribed onto the spell scroll.
- [Professor Aufel](../NPCs/Aufel%20Fernquill.md) casts telepathic bond on himself, [Gandour](../../Gandour%20Ironfleet.md), [Nos-Aji](../NPCs/Nos-Aji.md), [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md), [Professor Embersense](../NPCs/Dorfir%20Embersense.md), [Flavius](../../Flavius%20Underburrow.md), [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md) and [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md).
- The assault and infiltration parties discuss strategy. [Gandour](../../Gandour%20Ironfleet.md) remains near the [airship](../Items/Quest%20Items/Bloated%20Dragon.md). [Nos-Aji](../NPCs/Nos-Aji.md)'s and [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md)'s parties will distract the enemies and protect the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md)'s flanks.
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md)'s main goal is to escort the scholars to the [Temple of The Sealed Path](../Locations/Buildings/Temple%20of%20The%20Sealed%20Path.md).
## Obstacle Course
- A building collapses in front of the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md). [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) jumps across the wreckage using momentum from the [Evershift](../Items/Mythic%20Items/Evershift.md).
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) crosses a fissure caused by acid. [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) spots several [Wycroft Gladiators](../Factions/Wycroft%20Gladiators.md) wounded from battle.
- [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) heals the wounded [Wycroft Gladiators](../Factions/Wycroft%20Gladiators.md) and encourages them to fight.
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) encounters, and eventually defeats, a white dragon.
- As the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) nears the [Temple of The Sealed Path](../Locations/Buildings/Temple%20of%20The%20Sealed%20Path.md), they are contacted by [Nos-Aji](../NPCs/Nos-Aji.md) that he saw [Kayvan](../NPCs/Kayvan%20Acquermann.md) fighting near the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md)'s location. [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md), [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) and [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) stay back to find [Kayvan](../NPCs/Kayvan%20Acquermann.md), while the others escort the scholars into the stairs leading to the [Temple of The Sealed Path](../Locations/Buildings/Temple%20of%20The%20Sealed%20Path.md).
### Rescuing [Kayvan](../NPCs/Kayvan%20Acquermann.md)
- [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md), [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) and [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) find [Kayvan](../NPCs/Kayvan%20Acquermann.md) and other [Wycroft Gladiators](../Factions/Wycroft%20Gladiators.md) fighting a red dragon. The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) manages to save [Kayvan](../NPCs/Kayvan%20Acquermann.md) and two [Wycroft Gladiators](../Factions/Wycroft%20Gladiators.md) from the dragon.
- [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) reprimands [Kayvan](../NPCs/Kayvan%20Acquermann.md) for his reckless decision. [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) waits for [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md) to fetch [Kayvan](../NPCs/Kayvan%20Acquermann.md), while [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) and [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md) head to the [Temple of The Sealed Path](../Locations/Buildings/Temple%20of%20The%20Sealed%20Path.md).
### Following the Light
- [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md), [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md), [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md), [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md), [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) and the scholars enter the concealed entryway that the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) used before. Three blue wyrmlings attempt to ambush them, but fails.
- The three wyrmlings attack [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md) and [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) who are at the base of the stairs leading to the temple.
- During the combat, [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md) sees an apparition of [Amlaena](../Lore/Mythical%20Heroes/Amlaena%20Gustkil.md). The apparition helps [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md) rain down a shower of arrows toward the wyrmlings.
- After defeating the wyrmlings, [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md), [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md) and [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) ascend the stairs and head inside the concealed entryway. A red dragon blasts concentrated fire at the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md). The three members of the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) remain unscathed, but the entryway caves in from the attack.
