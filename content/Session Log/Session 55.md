# Stayin' Alive
## The Dead Rises (13th of Zagi)
- [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) senses the life thread of one of his allies severed. [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) leaves [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md), who was drunk, to [Flavius](../../Flavius%20Underburrow.md)'s care.
- [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) feels that the [Matunda's Mace](../Items/Mythic%20Items/Matunda's%20Mace.md) is leading him somewhere. He follows it.
- Meanwhile [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md), who is carrying [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md)'s body, shouts out to [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md). [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) and [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) eventually meet up. 
- [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) explains that [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) is struck dead. The two decide to go to [Foenyx](../Locations/Areas/Foenyx%20District.md). [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md)'s plan is to go to the [Chapel of Amlin](../Locations/Buildings/Chapel%20of%20Amlin.md) and consult [Drenn Halyx](../NPCs/Drenn%20Halyx.md). [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) asks [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) to obtain a diamond worth 500 gp.
### [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) strikes a deal
- [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) heads back to [Geraldt](../NPCs/Geraldt%20Dratzel.md)'s store. All stores are closed, so [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) knocks on one of the houses close to it. A rotund man shows on the upper floor window. After hearing [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md)' pleading, the man and [Geraldt](../NPCs/Geraldt%20Dratzel.md) shows himself to [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md). [Geraldt](../NPCs/Geraldt%20Dratzel.md) leads [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) to his store.
- [Geraldt](../NPCs/Geraldt%20Dratzel.md) agrees to sell diamond rings worth 750 gp. [Geraldt](../NPCs/Geraldt%20Dratzel.md) explains that the diamonds in total is worth 500 gp.
- [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) negotiates with [Geraldt](../NPCs/Geraldt%20Dratzel.md); he gives the shopkeeper 500 gp and his magic citrine stone in exchange for the diamond rings. After the deal, [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) heads back to the [Chapel of Amlin](../Locations/Buildings/Chapel%20of%20Amlin.md).
### Choices with consequences
- [Father Drenn](../NPCs/Drenn%20Halyx.md) opens the door to [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md). [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) consults [Father Drenn](../NPCs/Drenn%20Halyx.md). [Father Drenn](../NPCs/Drenn%20Halyx.md) warns [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) that using the Raise Dead spell will have consequences.
- [Father Drenn](../NPCs/Drenn%20Halyx.md) offers a safer alternative: cast Reincarnate spell using the priest's spell scroll. However, only a druid can cast the spell.
- As [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) is mulling the options, he hears a faint whisper; unfortunately he could not discern it. 
- [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) arrives, and he and [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) consider their options. They decide that [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) must cast the Raise Dead spell on [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md).
- [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) gives the diamond rings to [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md). As [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) is about to cast the spell, the [Matunda's Mace](../Items/Mythic%20Items/Matunda's%20Mace.md) glows; [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) put it near the body of [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md).
> *“O [Aisef](../Deities/New%20Gods/Aisef.md), gentle breath of spring, Healer of wounds seen and unseen, Hear now your servant’s trembling voice. I come not in pride, nor presumption, But in sorrow—heavy and raw. Life once bloomed in her, radiant and unbound— Let that bloom return, if it be thy will. But if her soul has wandered far, Beyond the meadows of breath and pulse… Then, O [Matunda](../Deities/Old%20Gods/Matunda.md)—keeper of the stillness, Guide of roots, womb of endings— I do not defy you. I ask only this: Lend your ear to the plea of a friend, Who cannot bear the silence she left behind.” “Between life and death, I stand— Not to conquer either, But to honor both. “By [Aisef](../Deities/New%20Gods/Aisef.md)’s mercy… By [Matunda](../Deities/Old%20Gods/Matunda.md)’s wisdom… And by the bonds not even death could cut— [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md)… Come home.”*
## Back to Base
- [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) and [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) exit the [Arena of the Dueling Swords](../Locations/Buildings/Arena%20of%20the%20Dueling%20Swords.md) with [Kayriel](../NPCs/Kayriel%20Acquermann.md)'s body on a steed. Three [Dusk Talons](../Factions/Dusk%20Talons.md) glide down from the nearby buildings to meet them. The [Dusk Talons](../Factions/Dusk%20Talons.md) talk to [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md).
> *"We've paid our debts. May we not cross paths again"*
- The [Dusk Talons](../Factions/Dusk%20Talons.md) hand [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) an emblem similar to what [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) received from his father. They pay respects to [Kayriel](../NPCs/Kayriel%20Acquermann.md)'s body.
- [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) and [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) walk back to the [Ironfleet Compound](../Locations/Buildings/Ironfleet%20Compound.md).
## The [Wycroft Gladiators](../Factions/Wycroft%20Gladiators.md)
### [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md)'s fight
- [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md) wakes up from her drunken stupor and sees [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) gone.
- [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md) surveys the workers' movements and comes to the conclusion that they must be soldiers. [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md) investigates and interrogates.
- [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md) sarcastically praises a worker's farming work to get a reaction. [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md)'s words anger the man, and he challenges [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md) to a fight.
- During the fight, the other workers gather and cheer [Rex](../NPCs/Rex%20Pons.md), the man who is fighting [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md). [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md) eventually surrenders. [Josh](../NPCs/Josiah%20Rendle.md), who was cheering [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md), administers basic aid and comforts [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md).
- [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md) talks to [Flavius](../../Flavius%20Underburrow.md). Out of nowhere, [Flavius](../../Flavius%20Underburrow.md) asks about [Gandour](../../Gandour%20Ironfleet.md) and [Remus](../NPCs/Remus%20Kyp.md); [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md) feigns ignorance. [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md) walks back to the [Ironfleet Compound](../Locations/Buildings/Ironfleet%20Compound.md).
- Along the way, [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md) sees [Flavius](../../Flavius%20Underburrow.md) and [Josh](../NPCs/Josiah%20Rendle.md) following her. She learns that the two are also going to the [Ironfleet Compound](../Locations/Buildings/Ironfleet%20Compound.md). [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md) walks on the other side of the road.
- [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md) meets [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) and [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md). [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) tells [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md) what transpired in the [arena](../Locations/Buildings/Arena%20of%20the%20Dueling%20Swords.md).
### Kinship between two dwarves
- [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) asks [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md) about her wounds. [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) points at [Flavius](../../Flavius%20Underburrow.md)'s direction, and the two dwarves confront each other.
- [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) and [Flavius](../../Flavius%20Underburrow.md) talk in Dwarvish. [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) learns that the workers in [Drakon](../Locations/Areas/Drakon%20District.md) are actually [Wycroft Gladiators](../Factions/Wycroft%20Gladiators.md), and that [Flavius](../../Flavius%20Underburrow.md) is an emissary from [Wycroft](../Locations/Kingdoms/Wycroft%20Mountain%20Kingdom.md). They are in [Midkip](../Locations/Settlements/Midkip.md) to help the people of [United Kippian](../Locations/Kingdoms/Kingdom%20of%20United%20Kippian.md) deal with the current crisis.
- [Flavius](../../Flavius%20Underburrow.md) sees [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md)'s [Vambrace Shields](../Items/Mythic%20Items/Vambrace%20Shields.md) and gushes at [Cappodon](../Lore/Mythical%20Heroes/Johannes%20Cappodon.md), an idol and hero to the [Wycroft Gladiators](../Factions/Wycroft%20Gladiators.md). The tension between the two dwarves diminishes.
- The two dwarves agree to a deal: [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) will accompany [Flavius](../../Flavius%20Underburrow.md) to meet [Prince Remus](../NPCs/Remus%20Kyp.md).
## A Haunting Vision
- [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) arrives at the [Ironfleet Compound](../Locations/Buildings/Ironfleet%20Compound.md) to recuperate. He takes a short rest.
- [Kayvan](../NPCs/Kayvan%20Acquermann.md) walks by the room where [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) is resting. [Kayvan](../NPCs/Kayvan%20Acquermann.md) tells Arc that he could not sleep due to a nightmare. He asks [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) where his allies are. [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) responds that he does not know. [Kayvan](../NPCs/Kayvan%20Acquermann.md) bids goodbye and leaves.
- [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) sees a shadow-like entity enter the window. The ghastly figure approaches [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) and passes through his body.
- [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) wakes up from the vision clutching his [Twilight Dagger](../Items/Mythic%20Items/Twilight%20Dagger.md).
## [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md)'s Revival
- [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) takes a long gasp; life and warmth flows into her. She regains consciousness.
- After seeing [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) brought back to life, [Father Drenn](../NPCs/Drenn%20Halyx.md) warns [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md):
> *"Now the hard part begins..."*
- [Father Drenn](../NPCs/Drenn%20Halyx.md) asks the three to leave the [chapel's](../Locations/Buildings/Chapel%20of%20Amlin.md) premises and lock the door. 
- Relieved of guilt, [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) hugs [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md). The three discuss their next action. They agree to accompany [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) to retrieve a piece of [Nokia](../PCs/Companions/Nokia.md).
- [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) bids his goodbye to [Father Drenn](../NPCs/Drenn%20Halyx.md), who is preparing for a religious rite.
- As they exit the [Chapel of Amlin](../Locations/Buildings/Chapel%20of%20Amlin.md), a [shadow](../../Greater%20Shadow.md) attacks them. [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) banishes it and the three escape to the direction of [Chapel of Aisef](../Locations/Buildings/Chapel%20of%20Aisef.md).
- Through his crow, [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) senses the [shadow](../../Greater%20Shadow.md) dissipate as dawn approaches.
