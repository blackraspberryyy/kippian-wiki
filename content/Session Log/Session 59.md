# Revelations, Part 2
## Hideout Raid
- [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) scouts the hideout and finds three guards. On a separate room, a blond elvish woman is wielding a bloodied [Aureate Rapier](../Items/Mythic%20Items/Aureate%20Rapier.md). The dead bodies of three [Dusk Talons](../Factions/Dusk%20Talons.md) lie on the floor.
- [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md), [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md), [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md), [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md), [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) and [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) assault the hideout. [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) casts Silence and [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) banishes one of the guards. [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md), [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md), [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) and [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) finish the other two guards.
- During the encounter, they see [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) sneaking into the hideout. [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) realizes that the place is [Kayriel](../NPCs/Kayriel%20Acquermann.md)'s hideout.
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) defeats the blond elf. [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) snatches the [Aureate Rapier](../Items/Mythic%20Items/Aureate%20Rapier.md) and hands it to [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md). [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) puts the elf in manacles and gags her to stop her from casting a spell.
- [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) realizes that the elf is using illusion magic to hide her true self. [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) realizes that the elf is an [Eladrin](../Factions/The%20Eladrin.md).
- [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) checks the a room, which turns out to be [Kayriel](../NPCs/Kayriel%20Acquermann.md)'s makeshift office. She retrieves a framed image of [Kayvan](../NPCs/Kayvan%20Acquermann.md).
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) decides to travel to [Ankyra's Old Castle Compound](../Locations/Buildings/Ankyra's%20Old%20Castle%20Compound.md) to put the blond elf in a cell.
### Arc's Memories
- The night before, [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) leaves the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) to pursue a memory. He remembers a hideout in [Midkip](../Locations/Settlements/Midkip.md). [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) scours [Midkip](../Locations/Settlements/Midkip.md) in search of the hideout.
- [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) finds a rock covering a secret entrance. He instinctively finds a button and opens it.
- [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) enters the hideout and finds the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) assaulting the three guards.
- [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) remembers the blond elf the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) has captured; however, he cannot recall his ties with her.
## Interrogation
- [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) carries the blond elf on a steed, and the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) follows him to [Ankyra's Old Castle Compound](../Locations/Buildings/Ankyra's%20Old%20Castle%20Compound.md). 
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) restrains the blond elf inside a cell. [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md) and [Michaela](../NPCs/Michaela%20Randall.md) join them to inquire about the elf.
- [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) calls [Remus](../NPCs/Remus%20Kyp.md) and [Mitarella](../NPCs/Mitarella%20Randall.md), informing the former that the [Aureate Rapier](../Items/Mythic%20Items/Aureate%20Rapier.md) has been retrieved.
- [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) telepathically talks with the blond elf. The elf identifies herself as [Vanayra](../../Vanayra%20Metorne.md), an [Eladrin](../Factions/The%20Eladrin.md) who was humiliated in a duel by [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md).
- [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) asks [Vanayra](../../Vanayra%20Metorne.md) about [Feypeak](../Locations/Areas/Feypeak.md). [Vanayra](../../Vanayra%20Metorne.md) answers that while she is an [Eladrin](../Factions/The%20Eladrin.md), she does not know how to open a portal from [Kippian](../Locations/Continents/Kippian.md) to the [Feywild](../Locations/Planes/Feywild.md). [Vanayra](../../Vanayra%20Metorne.md) claims that she is native to [Sumber](../Locations/Continents/Sumber.md), and only knows how to get to [Feywild](../Locations/Planes/Feywild.md) from there.
- [Vanayra](../../Vanayra%20Metorne.md) taunts [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md). [Vanayra](../../Vanayra%20Metorne.md) claims, with proof, that she and her allies killed [Idril](../../Idril%20Bluedrin.md) and [Poldo](../../Poldo%20Bluedrin.md), [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md)'s adoptive parents. [Vanayra](../../Vanayra%20Metorne.md) implicates [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) in the deed.
- [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) remembers that he and [Moon](../NPCs/Moon.md) did criminal acts for the blond elf.
- [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) assaults [Vanayra](../../Vanayra%20Metorne.md); [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) and [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) restrains [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md).
- [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) and [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) escort [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) out of the prison. [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) continues the interrogation.
- [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) learns that [Vanayra](../../Vanayra%20Metorne.md) is a spy for [The Cult of Miledu](../../The%20Cult%20of%20Miledu.md). [Vanayra](../../Vanayra%20Metorne.md), like [Kayriel](../NPCs/Kayriel%20Acquermann.md), is spying on [Sumber](../Locations/Continents/Sumber.md)'s political elite.
- [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) asks about [Kariil](../../Kariil%20Acquermann.md). [Vanayra](../../Vanayra%20Metorne.md) mentions that he is the son of [Korvin Acquermann](../../Korvin%20Acquermann.md), and is the inheritor of [Acquermann Clan](../../Acquermann%20Clan.md)'s legacy. [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) claims that he is the rightful heir to the [Acquermann Clan](../../Acquermann%20Clan.md)'s legacy.
- [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) also learns the dispute between members of [The Cult of Miledu](../../The%20Cult%20of%20Miledu.md). [Vanayra](../../Vanayra%20Metorne.md) tells [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) that it is but a distraction.
- [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) bluffs [Vanayra](../../Vanayra%20Metorne.md), telling her that the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) knows the location of [The Cult of Miledu](../../The%20Cult%20of%20Miledu.md), their end goal, and how to stop them. [Vanayra](../../Vanayra%20Metorne.md) is surprised, but she maintains that the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) is just too late to stop [the cult](../../The%20Cult%20of%20Miledu.md). [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) exits the cell and talks with the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md).
