# Between the Devil and the Undead
## Possessed
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) tries to interrogate [Auriel](../NPCs/Auriel%20Furwish.md), but soon learns that he is possessed. [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) casts greater restoration on [Auriel](../NPCs/Auriel%20Furwish.md). He sees a spirit leave [Auriel](../NPCs/Auriel%20Furwish.md)'s body. [Auriel](../NPCs/Auriel%20Furwish.md) drops unconscious.
- [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) retrieves a trinket from the departed spirit: a ring with a marked skull.
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) plans to travel to the [Chapel of Aisef](../Locations/Buildings/Chapel%20of%20Aisef.md) to consult [Father Ignatius](../NPCs/Ignatius%20Lavell.md). [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md)'s steed carries [Auriel](../NPCs/Auriel%20Furwish.md)'s unconscious body.
- Along the way to the [chapel](../Locations/Buildings/Chapel%20of%20Aisef.md), [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) experiences a vision: she sees a [Horned Devil](../../Horned%20Devil.md) reaching out its hand. The devil's palm touches [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md)'s forehead; this abruptly ends [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md)'s vision. 
- [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) spots a marking on [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md)'s forehead, similar to the skull markings during their encounter with [Calyxius](../../Calyxius.md). [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) is frightened.
## Hunted
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) arrives at the [Chapel of Aisef](../Locations/Buildings/Chapel%20of%20Aisef.md). Just as [Auriel](../NPCs/Auriel%20Furwish.md) enters the chapel's courtyard, he screams as his feet burn. [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) also burns upon entry.
- [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md), [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) and [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md) makes haste to find [Father Ignatius](../NPCs/Ignatius%20Lavell.md). The other members stay with [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) and [Auriel](../NPCs/Auriel%20Furwish.md).
- [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) spots a specter brandishing a scythe. The incorporeal entity attacks [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md).
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) successfully protects [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md). [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) explains that she saw a vision of a devil. 
- [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) finds out that [Father Ignatius](../NPCs/Ignatius%20Lavell.md) is gone.
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) decides to head to the [Chapel of Amlin](../Locations/Buildings/Chapel%20of%20Amlin.md) to meet [Father Drenn](../NPCs/Drenn%20Halyx.md) instead.
## [Father Drenn](../NPCs/Drenn%20Halyx.md)'s Guidance
- [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) meets with [Father Drenn](../NPCs/Drenn%20Halyx.md) and asks him about a devil possessing [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md). Surprised, [Father Drenn](../NPCs/Drenn%20Halyx.md) asks to inspect [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md).
- [Father Drenn](../NPCs/Drenn%20Halyx.md) realizes that [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) is being claimed by three entities: the undead, the devil [Calyxius](../../Calyxius.md), and her friends in the mortal realm.
- [Father Drenn](../NPCs/Drenn%20Halyx.md) sees [Auriel](../NPCs/Auriel%20Furwish.md) unconscious. He tells the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) that he was once an acquaintance of the [Furwish Clan](../../Furwish%20Clan.md), and that he knows a bit about [Auriel](../NPCs/Auriel%20Furwish.md). [Father Drenn](../NPCs/Drenn%20Halyx.md) is shocked to learn that [Auriel](../NPCs/Auriel%20Furwish.md) is practicing necromancy magic. 
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) decides to rest. They travel to a nearby inn.
## Rest for the Weary
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) arrives at [Ezekiel's Inn](../Locations/Buildings/Ezekiel's%20Inn.md). The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) rents two rooms for 16 gp. 
	- [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md), [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md), [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md), [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md), and [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md) occupy the first room.
	- [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md), [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md), [Auriel](../NPCs/Auriel%20Furwish.md), and [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) settle in the second room.
- The innkeeper, [Justicia](../NPCs/Justicia%20Holms.md), gives food to the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) members in the first room. [Justicia](../NPCs/Justicia%20Holms.md) asks if the marking on [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md)'s forehead is a new fashion trend, claiming that she saw another customer with the same marking. The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) coaxes [Justicia](../NPCs/Justicia%20Holms.md) to share details about the customer.
- [Justicia](../NPCs/Justicia%20Holms.md) mentions that a clean-shaven, middle-aged man named Michael has the same mark on his forehead. [Justicia](../NPCs/Justicia%20Holms.md) claims that the man rented a room yesterday, but has since left and yet to come back to the inn. [Justicia](../NPCs/Justicia%20Holms.md) also mentions that the man has been a customer in the past.
### Questions for the devil
- [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) asks [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) and [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) for help in asking the soul inside the trinket he retrieved earlier. He explains that he can ask the soul for information.
- The three choose to do [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md)'s deed in the inn's courtyard, away from both [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) and [Auriel](../NPCs/Auriel%20Furwish.md).
- [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) breaks the trinket and it crumbles into dust. A nefarious soul emerges from it and looms over him. [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) asks it what to do to remove [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md)'s marking.
- The devilish soul replies:
> *"You should win [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md)'s soul."*
- The soul then vanishes, leaving [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md), [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md), and [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) wondering what the the devil meant.
