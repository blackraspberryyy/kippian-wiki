# Fiendish Guardian
## Devil in Their Sights
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) feels unnatural heat emanating from the chamber they are going to. [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) scouts ahead.
- While waiting for [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md), [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md) and [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md) communicate to the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) that the [Wycroft Gladiators](../Factions/Wycroft%20Gladiators.md) and the others are retreating from [Yvernus](../Locations/Areas/Yvernus%20District.md).
- [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) returns back frightened. [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) says that there is an entity guarding the entrance to the inner chambers.
- [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md) casts arcane eye to take a look at the enemy. [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md) sees a winged fiend wielding a mace fashioned from marked skulls. The fiend detects the invisible arcane eye, which nearly strikes fear into [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md).
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) prepares for the inevitable combat with the fiend. [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) casts haste on both [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) and [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md). 
- [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) and [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) rushes in to fight the fiend head on while the others provide ranged damage and support. During the battle, the fiend telepathically taunts them to talk to him.
- [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) and [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) ask if the fiend is in league with [The Cult of Miledu](../../The%20Cult%20of%20Miledu.md). The fiend claims that it has its own goals.
- The fiend casts wall of fire to separate [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) and [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) from the others. [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) casts dispel magic on the wall, and he successfully dispels it.
- During the battle, the fiend notices [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md), and tells her that she owed her life to [Calyxius](../../Calyxius.md). The fiend demand to the others that they offer [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) to [Calyxius](../../Calyxius.md) in exchange for allowing the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) to pass through. The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) dismisses the fiend's request.
- The fiend suffers devastating blows from [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md), [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md), [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) and [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md). The fiend attempts to flee, but [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md) casts lightning bolt to stop the fiend from escaping through the hole on the chamber's ceiling.
- The fiend falls, and the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) kills it after it lands. The fiend dissipates, leaving only the accursed mace behind. [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) picks the mace, but the skulls on it dissolve and the mace turns into an ordinary one.
