## Rising Up

	- [Party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md)
	- [Leneia](../NPCs/Leneia%20Yarumcy.md), [Michaela](../NPCs/Michaela%20Randall.md) and [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md)
	- [Nos-Aji](../NPCs/Nos-Aji.md) and [Olrac](../NPCs/Olrac.md)

	- Two [airship](../Items/Quest%20Items/Bloated%20Dragon.md) engineers and six deckhands
	- [Severino](../NPCs/Severino%20Medlin.md) and three other [Wycroft](../Locations/Kingdoms/Wycroft%20Mountain%20Kingdom.md) Warmages
- [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) addresses the people in the [airship](../Items/Quest%20Items/Bloated%20Dragon.md).
> *"Face the problem head on. Don't overthink."*
- [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) appeals to the crew to avenge their loved ones.
> *"Turn your anger into strength."*
- [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) addresses the people assembled inside the courtyard. [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) repeats his previous speech, but he is met with subdued applause.
- [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) follows [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) and talks to the indifferent audience. She talks and instills courage to the soldiers who will fight the upcoming battle.
- [Gandour](../../Gandour%20Ironfleet.md) orders the deckhands and the engineers to man their respective stations.
- The [Bloated Dragon](../Items/Quest%20Items/Bloated%20Dragon.md) slowly rises in altitude.
## A Fiery Exchange
- [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md) spots a sonic explosion emanating from [Yvernus](../Locations/Areas/Yvernus%20District.md). An adult dragon and six wyrmlings, all red in color, fly toward the [airship](../Items/Quest%20Items/Bloated%20Dragon.md).
- A deckhand asks [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) if the dragon's fire is not magical, and hence is not rebuffed by the [Emerald of Protection Gem](../../Emerald%20of%20Protection%20Gem.md).
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) fights the seven dragons. [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md) kills the adult dragon, but not before the creature has dealt significant damage to both the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) and the [airship](../Items/Quest%20Items/Bloated%20Dragon.md).
