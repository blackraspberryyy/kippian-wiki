# A Dream to Forget
## A Devilish Dream
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) wakes up to a shared dream. They see a circular room with a table at the center.
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) realizes that [Auriel](../NPCs/Auriel%20Furwish.md) is also inside the room. [Auriel](../NPCs/Auriel%20Furwish.md) is pulled through the room by an invisible force and turns into a [Horned Devil](../../Horned%20Devil.md).
- The shadowy specter that attacked [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) appears near the table. The devil motions the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) to come closer and play a game. The devil says that the soul of [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) is at stake.
- [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) asks the devil and the specter what the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) stands to win. The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) would gain a favor from the devil and a [Revivifying Card](../../Revivifying%20Card.md) from the specter.
- The game ensues. The specter loses first, and then the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) loses to the devil. The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) sees [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) being engulfed in hellfire, and the dream ends.
## Long Rest (15th of Zagi)
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) wakes up and collectively remember the same dream. [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) wakes up with a tarot card bearing a diamond. [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md) briefly notices [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) having a burnt skin.
- [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) feels a little hot, but otherwise claims that she feels great. [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) goes to the other room to consult [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md) about the card.
- Meanwhile, in the other room, [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md), [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) and [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) wake up. They notice [Auriel](../NPCs/Auriel%20Furwish.md) continue being unresponsive.
- [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) knocks on their door and consults with [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md) regarding the card. The two soon recognize that it is the [Revivifying Card](../../Revivifying%20Card.md) they won from the specter.
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) decides to have a meeting. [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) calls [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md), [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md), [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) and [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) from the other room. The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) talks about the dream and [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md). 
- [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) casts Detect Thoughts on [Auriel](../NPCs/Auriel%20Furwish.md). [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) hears disembodied voices threatening to bring down [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md).
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) plans to consult [Father Drenn](../NPCs/Drenn%20Halyx.md). [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) and [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) stay at the inn to watch [Auriel](../NPCs/Auriel%20Furwish.md).
## Another Consultation
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) travels to the [Chapel of Amlin](../Locations/Buildings/Chapel%20of%20Amlin.md). [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) carefully enters the chapel's courtyard. She does not burn, but instead she feels feverish. 
- [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) steps out of the courtyard just to be safe, but her weird feeling did not dissipate. She hurls a flaming breath directed at the courtyard; nothing caught fire. [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) feels better after releasing the fire.
- Upon witnessing the event, [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) quickly goes to [Father Drenn](../NPCs/Drenn%20Halyx.md). [Father Drenn](../NPCs/Drenn%20Halyx.md) does not know what is happening to [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md).
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) goes back to [Ezekiel's Inn](../Locations/Buildings/Ezekiel's%20Inn.md). The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) makes a decision to travel to [Ankyra's Old Castle Compound](../Locations/Buildings/Ankyra's%20Old%20Castle%20Compound.md). They plan to make a stopover at the [Ironfleet Compound](../Locations/Buildings/Ironfleet%20Compound.md).
## Towards [Ankyra](../Locations/Areas/Ankyra%20District.md)
### [Ironfleet Compound](../Locations/Buildings/Ironfleet%20Compound.md)
- Upon arriving, the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) checks the progress on the [Bloated Dragon](../Items/Bloated%20Dragon.md). The airship's magical barrier is functioning but is not yet tested.
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) dines inside the [Ironfleet Compound](../Locations/Buildings/Ironfleet%20Compound.md)'s dining hall. [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) and [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) look at the floating [Yvernus](../Locations/Areas/Yvernus%20District.md). [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) claims to have seen the tail of a large creature there.
### [Ankyra's Old Castle Compound](../Locations/Buildings/Ankyra's%20Old%20Castle%20Compound.md)
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) travels to [Ankyra's Old Castle Compound](../Locations/Buildings/Ankyra's%20Old%20Castle%20Compound.md) to put [Auriel](../NPCs/Auriel%20Furwish.md) inside the prison. They see the courtyard filled with an army creating siege engines and makeshift encampments. A section of the courtyard is reserved for the refugees of [Yvernus](../Locations/Areas/Yvernus%20District.md).
- [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) peels away from the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) to meet [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md).
#### [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md) and [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md)
- [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) sees [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md) making meals to the refugees of [Yvernus](../Locations/Areas/Yvernus%20District.md).
- [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md) asks [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) what happened to the lead she gave the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md). [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) shares information about what transpired in the [Grand Cathedral](../Locations/Buildings/Grand%20Cathedral.md).
- [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md) tells [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) to be ready for the ensuing battle. [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) sees that [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md) is ready to destroy [Yvernus](../Locations/Areas/Yvernus%20District.md) to end the crisis.
- [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) asks [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md) about [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) seeing a tail of a large creature in [Yvernus](../Locations/Areas/Yvernus%20District.md). [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md) assures [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) that if there was a large dragon-like creature, their sentries would have spotted it.
#### [Janna](../NPCs/Janna%20Furwish.md)'s promise
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) meets [Janna](../NPCs/Janna%20Furwish.md) who is locked in prison. The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) tells [Janna](../NPCs/Janna%20Furwish.md) what happened to [Auriel](../NPCs/Auriel%20Furwish.md). [Janna](../NPCs/Janna%20Furwish.md) asks the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) to allow her to take care of [Auriel](../NPCs/Auriel%20Furwish.md). The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) hesitates; [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) goes to [Mitarella](../NPCs/Mitarella%20Randall.md) and [Remus](../NPCs/Remus%20Kyp.md) to seek their approval.
- [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) sees [Mitarella](../NPCs/Mitarella%20Randall.md) and [Remus](../NPCs/Remus%20Kyp.md) swamped in logistical paperwork. They delegate the decision to [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) and the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md).
- Before [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) leaves, [Mitarella](../NPCs/Mitarella%20Randall.md) and [Remus](../NPCs/Remus%20Kyp.md) ask him to tell the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) to be prepared for the upcoming battle.
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) opens the cell and allows [Janna](../NPCs/Janna%20Furwish.md) to tend to [Auriel](../NPCs/Auriel%20Furwish.md).
- [Janna](../NPCs/Janna%20Furwish.md) assures the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) that they can trust her to help them dismantle [The Cult of Miledu](../../The%20Cult%20of%20Miledu.md)' s plans. [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) feels that there is an ulterior goal behind [Janna](../NPCs/Janna%20Furwish.md)'s promise.
- [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) waits for the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) to leave to talk to [Janna](../NPCs/Janna%20Furwish.md)
- [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) shares that an entity inhabits [Auriel](../NPCs/Auriel%20Furwish.md)'s psyche. [Janna](../NPCs/Janna%20Furwish.md) acknowledges this, claiming that this is a result of [Auriel](../NPCs/Auriel%20Furwish.md) practicing necromancy and demonology.
