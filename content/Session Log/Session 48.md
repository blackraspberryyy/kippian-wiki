# Sorrow, Sand, and Stone
## Morning (9th of Zagi)
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) takes a long rest.
- [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md), [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md), and [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) help airship. [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) notices that the airship' cannon deck desperately lacks gloompowder.
- [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) asks [Olrac](../NPCs/Olrac.md), who is arguing with a servant outside, where to source gloompowder. [Olrac](../NPCs/Olrac.md) directs [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) to [Nos](../NPCs/Nos-Aji.md).
- [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) scouts the district and finds a three-carriage supply run from [Ankyra's Old Castle Compound](../Locations/Buildings/Ankyra's%20Old%20Castle%20Compound.md) traveling to [Ironfleet Compound](../Locations/Buildings/Ironfleet%20Compound.md). He follows it and he meets [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md).
- [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md) asks [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) where to find [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) and [Kayvan](../../Kayvan%20Acquermann.md); [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) supplies their location.
- [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) prepares a breakfast of bacon and eggs, bread, and hot chocolate for two. He plans to talk to [Kayvan](../../Kayvan%20Acquermann.md).
- On the way to [Kayvan](../../Kayvan%20Acquermann.md)'s room, [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) meets [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md). [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md) invites [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md), and later [Kayvan](../../Kayvan%20Acquermann.md), to a personal conversation.
- [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md) explains to [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) that the 9th of Zagi is a special date to her. She commemorates the anniversary of [Kristofer](../../Kristofer%20Acquermann.md)'s disappearance on this day.
- It appears to [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) that [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md) has accepted their father's absence. [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) shares that he is still hopeful that their father is still alive; [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md) is grateful for [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md)' optimism.
- [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md) invites [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) later for remembering their missing father. [Kayvan](../../Kayvan%20Acquermann.md) is also invited to come.
- [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) finds [Nos](../NPCs/Nos-Aji.md) in a workshop/storage room experimenting on some chemicals. [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) asks [Nos](../NPCs/Nos-Aji.md) where to find gloompowder. [Nos](../NPCs/Nos-Aji.md) explains that their supply is dwindling, and that he is trying to find the process of creating gloompowder. [Gandour](../../Gandour%20Ironfleet.md) has generously provided the equipment and chemicals to experiment, but they still lack blacksand, the base substance for creating gloompowder.
- [Nos](../NPCs/Nos-Aji.md) explains that they can find blacksand within coastal caves.
- [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) promises [Nos](../NPCs/Nos-Aji.md) that they will find some blacksand. [Nos](../NPCs/Nos-Aji.md) gifts [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) a cork-shaped trinket that can attract blacksand.
- [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) shares the problem with the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md). The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) plans on checking the northwestern coast for some blacksand later in the day.
## Blacksand Debacle
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md), minus [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) and [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md), rides on a boat. Their boat tugs a smaller boat containing digging tools and some empty barrels. The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md), upon exiting the river's mouth, follows the western coastline.
- After being an hour away from the [Midkip](../Locations/Settlements/Midkip.md), [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) played a prank on the party by seemingly getting drowned. [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md) attempted to rescue [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md). It appears that the water at that point is just human-neck high. 
- Upon resurfacing, the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) sees traces of blacksand on both [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) and [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md). [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) gives her trinket to [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md) and asks her to investigate.
- [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md) is pulled below the water. [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) attempts to save [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md), but to no avail. [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) asks for the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md)'s help using telepathy.
- The others, except [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md), jumps into the shallow sea to save the two. [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) prepares the boat for an impact from a 5-foot tall wave.
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) is washed ashore; [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) draws the inhaled seawater from [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md)'s lungs.
- [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) sees a creature made of sand rushing into them. [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) jumps into the shore.
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) confronts a blacksand-based creature. [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md), and later the other members of the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md), ascertains that the blacksand combusts explosively. The explosion was too strong that the sound it produced reaches [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md).
- The creature throws [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) into the sea. Out of options, [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) casts a Fireball from his [Bloodstone Arcane Gem](../../Bloodstone%20Arcane%20Gem.md). The creature explodes, but not without creating a significant damage to the party.
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) lost material things, including [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md)'s adventure diary and [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md)'s violin. Moreover, they fail to retrieve blacksand. [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) fortunately did not lose her stuff due to being submerged underwater during the explosion.
## Licking Wounds
- [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) finds [Nokia](../PCs/Companions/Nokia.md) but it is turned into cracked stone statue. [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) casts Stone Shape to mend the cracks.
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) decides to walk back to the [Ironfleet Compound](../Locations/Buildings/Ironfleet%20Compound.md). [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) casts Find Steed, and he and [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md) rushes back.
- [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) and [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md) meets [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) in the courtyard and explains to them what happened. Afterwards, [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) talks to [Nos](../NPCs/Nos-Aji.md) and admits that they failed in retrieving the blacksand.
- [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md), [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md), [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) and [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) arrives at the [Ironfleet Compound](../Locations/Buildings/Ironfleet%20Compound.md). They meet [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md) and [Gandour](../../Gandour%20Ironfleet.md) who are talking in the courtyard. [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md), frustrated about [Nokia](../PCs/Companions/Nokia.md), walks away from the conversation.
- The three share what happened to them. [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md) notices the statue-turned [Nokia](../PCs/Companions/Nokia.md) and shares a myth of a gorgon that can turn flesh into stone, and vice versa. She thinks that it could be relevant, and shares that a capable wizard might know a solution to revert the petrification.
- [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) returns the trinket back to [Nos](../NPCs/Nos-Aji.md).
