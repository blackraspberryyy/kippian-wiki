# Prayers and Promises
## Sleeping Woes
- [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) knocks out and secures [Kariil](../../Kariil%20Acquermann.md).
- [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md) attempts to cast scrying on [Vanayra](../../Vanayra%20Metorne.md), but fails. [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md) then checks the location where [Vanayra](../../Vanayra%20Metorne.md) exited the prison. [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md) thinks that [Vanayra](../../Vanayra%20Metorne.md) must have casted a transmutation spell to magically teleport out of the prison.
- [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) suggests to take a long rest inside [Labyrinthus](../Locations/Areas/Labyrinthus.md). [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md), [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md), [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) and [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) agree to [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md)'s plan. [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md) leaves a note to [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md), [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) and [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md).
- [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) persuades [April](../NPCs/April%20Torgall.md), a royal guard, to protect the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) while they rest. [April](../NPCs/April%20Torgall.md) suggests to the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) to enter [Labyrinthus](../Locations/Areas/Labyrinthus.md) while inside the castle. The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) accede [April](../NPCs/April%20Torgall.md)'s suggestion and enter [Labyrinthus](../Locations/Areas/Labyrinthus.md) under the protection of the royal guards.
- [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md), [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md), [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md), [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md), [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) and [Kariil](../../Kariil%20Acquermann.md) enter [Labyrinthus](../Locations/Areas/Labyrinthus.md).
## Inside [Labyrinthus](../Locations/Areas/Labyrinthus.md)
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) feels that the [Labyrinthus](../Locations/Areas/Labyrinthus.md) is unnaturally cold. [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) feels that they are under the gaze of another creature.
- [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) uses his divine sense to see if there are any threats. [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) observes [Kariil](../../Kariil%20Acquermann.md) and she notices that [Kariil](../../Kariil%20Acquermann.md)'s skin is as cold as the ambient temperature, and his shadow seems to blend into the other shadows. [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) thinks that [Kariil](../../Kariil%20Acquermann.md) has some [Eladrin](../Factions/The%20Eladrin.md) lineage.
- [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) casts legend lore about [Acquermann](../../Acquermann%20Clan.md)'s lineage, looking for any [Eladrin](../Factions/The%20Eladrin.md) blood. [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) fails to find a connection between the [Acquermanns](../../Acquermann%20Clan.md) and [Eladrins](../Factions/The%20Eladrin.md).
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) decide to sleep; [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) watches over the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md).
### [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md)'s Dream
- [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) wakes up to find that everyone except him is asleep. [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) looks for [Kariil](../../Kariil%20Acquermann.md).
- [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) walks out of a pitch black room and emerges out of a cave under a tree. [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) realizes that he is in a dream. Then, a fog envelops [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md).
- [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) sees a castle-like structure on top of a low-lying hill. The gate opens and [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) enters it and is immediately transported inside a great dining hall.
- [Kariil](../../Kariil%20Acquermann.md) welcomes [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md). [Kariil](../../Kariil%20Acquermann.md) explains that they are here to meet someone. After a while, [Kariil](../../Kariil%20Acquermann.md) disappears.
- [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) meets [Kristofer](../../Kristofer%20Acquermann.md), his father.
> *"[Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md), welcome to my domain."*
- [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) asks [Kristofer](../../Kristofer%20Acquermann.md) where he has been all this time. [Kristofer](../../Kristofer%20Acquermann.md) points to [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md)'s forehead and responds that he is here. [Kariil](../../Kariil%20Acquermann.md) reappears and have a lighthearted chat with [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) and [Kristofer](../../Kristofer%20Acquermann.md).
- [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) is confused that [Kristofer](../../Kristofer%20Acquermann.md) and [Kariil](../../Kariil%20Acquermann.md) are amiable with each other. The confusion wakes [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) up from the dream.
### [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md)'s Dilemma
- [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) feels that he is losing attunement with the [Twilight Dagger](../Items/Mythic%20Items/Twilight%20Dagger.md). After investigating, the [Twilight Dagger](../Items/Mythic%20Items/Twilight%20Dagger.md) beckons [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) to kill [Kariil](../../Kariil%20Acquermann.md).
- [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) stabs [Kariil](../../Kariil%20Acquermann.md). [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) wakes up and restrains [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md).
- [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) casts cure wounds on [Kariil](../../Kariil%20Acquermann.md). With the help of [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) and [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md), [Kariil](../../Kariil%20Acquermann.md)'s wounds close but remains unconscious.
- [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) hears a voice urging him to kill [Kariil](../../Kariil%20Acquermann.md). [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) refuses the voice and thrusts the [Twilight Dagger](../Items/Mythic%20Items/Twilight%20Dagger.md) through the floor.
- [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) puts [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) in a bind.
- [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) fashions a stone vial by casting stone shape. She scoops up [Kariil](../../Kariil%20Acquermann.md)'s blood.
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) decide to continue resting.
### [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md)'s Visions
- [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) dreams as if he was the [Twilight Dagger](../Items/Mythic%20Items/Twilight%20Dagger.md). [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) sees [Kayriel](../NPCs/Kayriel%20Acquermann.md) and [Kariil](../../Kariil%20Acquermann.md) as individuals who once owned the [Twilight Dagger](../Items/Mythic%20Items/Twilight%20Dagger.md).
## The Other [Party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md)
- [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md), [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md) and [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) wake up. [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) sees a note from [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md).
> We'll sleep inside [Labyrinthus](../Locations/Areas/Labyrinthus.md) because we have no time to rest.
> 
> [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md)
- [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md), [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) and [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) find an empty cell. The three exit the prison to ask the guards what happened.
- The guards explain that [Vanayra](../../Vanayra%20Metorne.md) escaped, but they captured [Kariil](../../Kariil%20Acquermann.md).
- [Roman](../NPCs/Roman%20Silverfox.md) puts a blade on [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md)'s throat. [Roman](../NPCs/Roman%20Silverfox.md) threatens her. The two parties resolve their differences as the time for assault nears.
- [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md), [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md) and [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) enter the castle and find a spell circle with the [Arcanus Labyrinthus](../../Arcanus%20Labyrinthus.md) at the center.
### Exiting [Labyrinthus](../Locations/Areas/Labyrinthus.md)
- [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md), [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md), [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md), [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) and [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) wake up fully-rested.
- [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) wraps the [Twilight Dagger](../Items/Mythic%20Items/Twilight%20Dagger.md) with a thick cloth.
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) exits the [Labyrinthus](../Locations/Areas/Labyrinthus.md) with an unconscious [Kariil](../../Kariil%20Acquermann.md). They see [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md), [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md) and [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) waiting for them.
## Fully Rested (17th of Zagi)
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) discuss events that happened during the night. [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) stashes the [Twilight Dagger](../Items/Mythic%20Items/Twilight%20Dagger.md) inside [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md)'s bag of holding. Afterwards, he frees [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) from his binds.
- [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) attempts to give gold to [April](../NPCs/April%20Torgall.md) and the guards as thanks. [April](../NPCs/April%20Torgall.md) refuses, and claims that their heroism and sacrifice are more than enough. [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) chips her [Aureate Rapier](../Items/Mythic%20Items/Aureate%20Rapier.md) and gives it to [April](../NPCs/April%20Torgall.md).
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) exits the castle and they see [Mitarella](../NPCs/Mitarella%20Randall.md) and [Remus](../NPCs/Remus%20Kyp.md) discussing something. They also see [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md) assisting the survivors from [Yvernus](../Locations/Areas/Yvernus%20District.md). [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md) signals the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) to wait for her.
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) hatches a plan to catch [Vanayra](../../Vanayra%20Metorne.md).  An impatient [Remus](../NPCs/Remus%20Kyp.md) and a self-assured [Mitarella](../NPCs/Mitarella%20Randall.md) approach the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md). [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) senses that [Remus](../NPCs/Remus%20Kyp.md) is being sheltered by [Mitarella](../NPCs/Mitarella%20Randall.md).
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) learns that it was [Mitarella](../NPCs/Mitarella%20Randall.md)'s idea to seek help from [Sumber](../Locations/Continents/Sumber.md), particularly from the [Followers of Yekora](../Factions/Followers%20of%20Yekora.md).
### Inside the Carriage...
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) enters the carriage and wait for [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md).
- [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md) and the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) talk about the [Acquermanns](../../Acquermann%20Clan.md) connection with [The Eladrin](../Factions/The%20Eladrin.md). [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md) makes the connection that maybe [Kariil](../../Kariil%20Acquermann.md)'s mother is an [Eladrin](../Factions/The%20Eladrin.md). 
- [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) gives the stone vial containing [Kariil](../../Kariil%20Acquermann.md)'s blood to [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md).
- [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md) spots [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) preparing a scrying spell targeting [Vanayra](../../Vanayra%20Metorne.md). [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md) states her opinion that the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) needs all the resources that they have, and the spell might be wasted if they cannot pursue [Vanayra](../../Vanayra%20Metorne.md).
## [Ironfleet Compound](../Locations/Buildings/Ironfleet%20Compound.md)
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) arrive at the [Ironfleet Compound](../Locations/Buildings/Ironfleet%20Compound.md). [Michaela](../NPCs/Michaela%20Randall.md) and [Kayvan](../NPCs/Kayvan%20Acquermann.md) greet the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md).

- [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md) thinks that [Kristofer](../../Kristofer%20Acquermann.md) might be alive, and is sending a message to [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md).
- [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md) ponders if [Kristofer](../../Kristofer%20Acquermann.md) is residing in [Shadowfell](../Locations/Planes/Shadowfell.md). [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md) thinks that [Yvernus](../Locations/Areas/Yvernus%20District.md) holds information on how to travel to [Shadowfell](../Locations/Planes/Shadowfell.md). [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) agrees:

This act symbolizes the closeness between [Michaela](../NPCs/Michaela%20Randall.md) and [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md).
### [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md)'s Visions, Part 2
- [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md) sees his visions repeating; each vision is slightly different, but all of them concludes with the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) falling to their foe.
- However, his last vision shows [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md) a marked improvement on their chances against their foe: [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) displaying a new skill with the [Twilight Dagger](../Items/Mythic%20Items/Twilight%20Dagger.md).
