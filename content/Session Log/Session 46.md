# On Different Matters
## [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md) explaining her absence...
- [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md) explained to the party that she was exploring [Midkip](../Locations/Settlements/Midkip.md) on her own to find some solace and to survey for weapons and armor.
- On her visit to [Drakon](../Locations/Areas/Drakon%20District.md), she saw people gathering in groups; Noah remembered the [Drakon](../Locations/Areas/Drakon%20District.md) problem she and [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md) once encountered: the [Malandar Rebellion](../../Malandar%20Rebellion.md).
## Morning (7th of Zagi)
- [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md), [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md) and [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) help in the construction.
- [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md), [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) and [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md) go to a dedicated place of worship within [Ironfleet Compound](../Locations/Buildings/Ironfleet%20Compound.md) and pray to their respective patron deity.
- [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) meets [Djorken](../NPCs/Djorken%20Veegar.md) discussing political matters with a group of disgruntled rural folk from [Drakon](../Locations/Areas/Drakon%20District.md). They are clamoring for stability during these uncertain times. 
- [Djorken](../NPCs/Djorken%20Veegar.md) asks [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) to help him calm the people. [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) performs and successfully calms the people. [Djorken](../NPCs/Djorken%20Veegar.md) explains the situation and promises to ask for help in resolving the political matter.
- [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) scouts the surroundings for [Dusk Talon](../Factions/Dusk%20Talons.md) assassins, but sees none. He observes more [Chtapodhi](../Locations/Areas/Chtapodhi%20District.md)'s residents walking freely near the [Ironfleet Compound](../Locations/Buildings/Ironfleet%20Compound.md).
- [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) steals 10 gp and a propaganda poster from a tattered rucksack. The following text is written on the poster:
> Death to the Veegars,
>  
> Death to the dragonborn,
> 
> Rebels for Malandar,
> 
> Malandar for Drakon!
## Lunch meeting
- [Gandour](../../Gandour%20Ironfleet.md) explains that the construction of the airship is progressing. However, he explains that it needs a magical barrier to withstand attacks.
- [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) speaks to [Kayvan](../../Kayvan%20Acquermann.md) that she met his father. [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) did not share much, only that his father has asked about him.
- [Djorken](../NPCs/Djorken%20Veegar.md) asks for the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md)'s help. He asks the party to quell the [Malandar Rebellion](../../Malandar%20Rebellion.md).
- [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md), [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) and [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md) plan to go to the [Ankyra's Old Castle Compound](../Locations/Buildings/Ankyra's%20Old%20Castle%20Compound.md) and search for ways to create a magical barrier.
- [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md), [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md), [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md), [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) and [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md) go to [Drakon district](../Locations/Areas/Drakon%20District.md) to gauge the situation. [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) convinces [Djorken](../NPCs/Djorken%20Veegar.md) to accompany them, saying that he'll protect him from possible harm.
## Into [Drakon](../Locations/Areas/Drakon%20District.md)
- The [Drakon](../Locations/Areas/Drakon%20District.md) [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) surveys the residents of the district about political matters. The informed residents are split; half supports the industrialization proposed by the [Malandar Rebellion](../../Malandar%20Rebellion.md), while the other half deems that the district's agricultural tradition must be upheld.
- [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md) asks [Djorken](../NPCs/Djorken%20Veegar.md) about his stance. [Djorken](../NPCs/Djorken%20Veegar.md) tells them that he needs a formal nomination from both the [Drakon](../Locations/Areas/Drakon%20District.md)'s leaders and the [High Council](../Factions/The%20High%20Council%20of%20Midkip.md) before he assumes the district representative position held by his late adoptive father, [Gokare Veegar](../NPCs/Gokare%20Veegar.md).
- The [Drakon](../Locations/Areas/Drakon%20District.md) [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) travels to an [Drakon Amphitheater](../Locations/Buildings/Drakon's%20Open%20Amphitheater.md) where there is a political rally being held. The rally is for [Raveena Malandar](../NPCs/Raveena%20Malandar.md).
- The rally calls on the supporters of the [Malandar Rebellion](../../Malandar%20Rebellion.md) to harass the dragonborn residents of [Drakon District](../Locations/Areas/Drakon%20District.md).
- [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) writes a note with [Raveena's](../NPCs/Raveena%20Malandar.md) speech on it added with an incriminating note saying that [Raveena](../NPCs/Raveena%20Malandar.md) is a member of [The Cult of Miledu](../../The%20Cult%20of%20Miledu.md).
- [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) and [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) disguise as guards and successfully infiltrate the cadre of veteran guards escorting [Raveena Malandar](../NPCs/Raveena%20Malandar.md).
- [Raveena Malandar](../NPCs/Raveena%20Malandar.md) exits the stage. [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) and [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) follow her. They follow her into a deserted grass park with large-trunked trees. [Raveena](../NPCs/Raveena%20Malandar.md) hides behind one, and the two follow her.
- They hear her talking to another cloaked individual. After a long silence on her part, the other individual talks. She tells [Raveena](../NPCs/Raveena%20Malandar.md) that she needs her help in the dispute within their faction.
- [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) and [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) determine that the cloaked individual is [Janna Furwish](../NPCs/Janna%20Furwish.md).
- After the conversation, [Janna](../NPCs/Janna%20Furwish.md) leaves, prompting [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) and [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) to action.  The two manage to knock out and capture [Raveena](../NPCs/Raveena%20Malandar.md).
- [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) assumes [Raveena Malandar](../NPCs/Raveena%20Malandar.md)'s identity. He goes back to the [Drakon Amphitheater](../Locations/Buildings/Drakon's%20Open%20Amphitheater.md) as [Raveena](../NPCs/Raveena%20Malandar.md) and without speaking, announces her leave to the guards. [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) then messages the [Drakon](../Locations/Areas/Drakon%20District.md) [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) to meet him and [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) at a specific place within [Drakon](../Locations/Areas/Drakon%20District.md).
- The [Drakon](../Locations/Areas/Drakon%20District.md) [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) saw [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) and [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) carrying [Raveena](../NPCs/Raveena%20Malandar.md) who is bound and unconscious. [Djorken](../NPCs/Djorken%20Veegar.md) is startled, but [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) manages to convince him that this is the best course to take. [Djorken](../NPCs/Djorken%20Veegar.md) reluctantly agrees, and shares his knowledge of a less-traveled route back to the [Ironfleet Compound](../Locations/Buildings/Ironfleet%20Compound.md) that would attract the least attention.
- The [Drakon](../Locations/Areas/Drakon%20District.md) [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) carries [Raveena Malandar](../NPCs/Raveena%20Malandar.md) back to the [Ironfleet Compound](../Locations/Buildings/Ironfleet%20Compound.md).
## Field (barrier) research
- The [Ankyra](../Locations/Areas/Ankyra%20District.md) [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) travels to the [Ankyra's Old Castle Compound](../Locations/Buildings/Ankyra's%20Old%20Castle%20Compound.md) to gather information. They meet [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md) and she directs them to the library.
- [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) scans the library for any reference of [Eladrins](../Factions/The%20Eladrin.md) and [Feypeak](../Locations/Areas/Feypeak.md), but to no avail.
- [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) searches for a book that could help [Gandour](../../Gandour%20Ironfleet.md) implement the magical barrier spell for the airship. She finds an abjuration reference book, but the librarian would not let her borrow the book unless she trades a personal effect. [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) refuses to trade her amulet.
- [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) trades the bow of her violin for the reference book.
- [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md) asks [Professor Aufel](../../Aufel%20Fernquill.md) for some guidance on field barrier spells. [Professor Aufel](../../Aufel%20Fernquill.md) tells [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md) that [Professor Embersense](../NPCs/Dorfir%20Embersense.md) might have knowledge on the matter.
- According to [Professor Aufel](../../Aufel%20Fernquill.md), [Professor Embersense](../NPCs/Dorfir%20Embersense.md) is transcribing and translating spells from ancient times, particularly spells from [Primordial Ages](../Lore/Eons%20and%20Ages/Primordial%20Ages.md) and [Eon of Akenatun's Descent](../Lore/Eons%20and%20Ages/Eon%20of%20Akenatun's%20Descent.md).
- [Professor Aufel](../../Aufel%20Fernquill.md) also tells [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md) that [Professor Embersense](../NPCs/Dorfir%20Embersense.md) took [Fiamil](../NPCs/Fiamil%20Underwood.md) as his disciple.
- [Professor Aufel](../../Aufel%20Fernquill.md) asks [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md) about their deal for him to examine the [Ymerald Staff](../Items/Mythic%20Items/Ymerald%20Staff.md) in exchange for a spell. [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md) obliges.
- After his examination of the [Ymerald Staff](../Items/Mythic%20Items/Ymerald%20Staff.md), [Professor Aufel](../../Aufel%20Fernquill.md) discerns that the driftwood handle and manner of the staff is substandard and less than ideal. More importantly, he gleaned that the affixed emerald gemstone cannot be created using natural nor known magical processes: therefore, it must have an extraterrestrial origin.
- The [Ankyra](../Locations/Areas/Ankyra%20District.md) [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) travels back to the [Ironfleet Compound](../Locations/Buildings/Ironfleet%20Compound.md). There, they meet the [Drakon](../Locations/Areas/Drakon%20District.md) [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) accompanying the captured [Raveena Malandar](../NPCs/Raveena%20Malandar.md).
