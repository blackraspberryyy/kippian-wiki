## Morning Interrogation (8th of Zagi)
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) wakes up. 
- [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) prepares and casts Zone of Truth. [Raveena](../NPCs/Raveena%20Malandar.md) fails.
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) interrogates [Raveena](../NPCs/Raveena%20Malandar.md). 
- [Raveena](../NPCs/Raveena%20Malandar.md) reveals the masterminds of the cult are [Roldan](../../Roldan%20Vinke.md), [Rickard](../NPCs/Rickard%20Kyp.md) and [Elvin](../../Elvin%20Claymore.md).
- [Raveena](../NPCs/Raveena%20Malandar.md) cannot remember the name of the mysterious [Acquermann](../../Acquermann%20Clan.md).
- [Rickard](../NPCs/Rickard%20Kyp.md) is revealed to be [Raveena](../NPCs/Raveena%20Malandar.md)'s recruiter.

- [Raveena](../NPCs/Raveena%20Malandar.md) aims to lead [Drakon](../Locations/Areas/Drakon%20District.md) into an industrious future.
- [The Cult of Miledu](../../The%20Cult%20of%20Miledu.md) recruited [Raveena](../NPCs/Raveena%20Malandar.md) to inform members and create propaganda.
- [Raveena](../NPCs/Raveena%20Malandar.md) claims the [Theater Incident](../../Theater%20Incident.md) as her and [Roldan](../../Roldan%20Vinke.md)'s idea. The idea was to gauge public perception regarding the [The Cult of Miledu](../../The%20Cult%20of%20Miledu.md).
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) is about to hurt [Raveena](../NPCs/Raveena%20Malandar.md), but [Djorken](../../Djorken%20Veegar.md) interjects. He tells [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) that they can use her to quell the [Malandar Rebellion](../../Malandar%20Rebellion.md).
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) decides to lock up [Raveena](../NPCs/Raveena%20Malandar.md) in [Ankyra](../Locations/Areas/Ankyra%20District.md), where [Rickard](../NPCs/Rickard%20Kyp.md) and [Malvin](../NPCs/Malvin%20Randall.md) are also jailed.
## Incarceration
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) travels to [Ankyra](../Locations/Areas/Ankyra%20District.md). During their travel, [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) and [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) have a sincere talk regarding faith.
- [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md) splits away from the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) to research with [Professor Aufel](../../Aufel%20Fernquill.md).
- [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) and [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) talks to [Mitarella](../../Mitarella%20Randall.md) regarding [Raveena](../NPCs/Raveena%20Malandar.md); the regent breathes a sigh of relief. [Mitarella](../../Mitarella%20Randall.md) assigns [Michaela](../../Michaela%20Randall.md) to lead them to the dungeon.
- [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) notices [Michaela](../../Michaela%20Randall.md) and [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md) having a deep talk.
- [Raveena](../NPCs/Raveena%20Malandar.md) is placed inside her cell. As they were about to go out, [Rickard](../NPCs/Rickard%20Kyp.md) shouts and laughs mockingly:
> *"It's about time now! You won't have to wait long..."*
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) talks to the guards and [Michaela](../../Michaela%20Randall.md) about their worries. [Michaela](../../Michaela%20Randall.md) assures them that keeping them in one location saves resources and time, which the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) badly needs.
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) decides to head back to the [Ironfleet Compound](../Locations/Buildings/Ironfleet%20Compound.md). [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md) stays in [Ankyra](../Locations/Areas/Ankyra%20District.md) to research.
- [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md) spots [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) stealing a purse from a commoner.
- [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md), during his research, studies the Vitriolic Sphere spell.
## Back to [Ironfleet Compound](../Locations/Buildings/Ironfleet%20Compound.md)
- During their travel, [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md) and [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) continue their conversation about faith. [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) hears a divine whisper emanating from [Matunda's Mace](../Items/Mythic%20Items/Matunda's%20Mace.md).
- [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) gives the abjuration reference book to [Gandour](../../Gandour%20Ironfleet.md).
- [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) and [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) inspects the airship. [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) is in awe of the airship; [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) sees casters experimenting on abjuration magic.
- [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) enters the chapel and directs his plea to [Aisef](../Deities/New%20Gods/Aisef.md). He hears the divine whisper clearer:
> *"[The Old God](../Deities/Old%20Gods/Pantheon%20of%20the%20Old%20Gods.md) will set you free. I will set you free. Trust in me. I will lead you to the truth."*
- [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) is thrusted into a vision of the past where [Aisef](../Deities/New%20Gods/Aisef.md) is kneeling in front of a shrine set on an open field. [Aisef](../Deities/New%20Gods/Aisef.md) appears to be kneeling; [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) observes [Aisef](../Deities/New%20Gods/Aisef.md) in deep conflict about his faith. A woman figure appears to [Aisef](../Deities/New%20Gods/Aisef.md). Her response mirrors the whisper [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) heard in the chapel.
> *"The truth will set you free. I will set you free."*
- Then, the woman figure opens her hand, and [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) sees the symbol of [Matunda](../Deities/Old%20Gods/Matunda.md) inscribed on her palm. The figure then faces [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) and imparts a premonition:
> *"You are destined for greater things."*
- [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md) has a dream; the dream involves her during the dinner scene when [Agatha](../../Agatha.md) appeared to her. This time, however, [Agatha](../../Agatha.md)'s voice is clearer.
> *"The answer you seek is in [Suirsya](../Locations/Continents/Suirsya.md)..."*
