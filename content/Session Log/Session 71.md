# Infiltration, Phase 1
## Following a Vision
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) takes a short rest. [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md), after witnessing the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md)'s near defeat from a red dragon, finally tells the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) about his vision about [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) and the [Twilight Dagger](../Items/Mythic%20Items/Twilight%20Dagger.md). According to [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md), [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) must unlock the weapon's potential if they want to defeat the draconic enemy in [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md)'s visions.
- [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md), supported by [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md)'s own experience, tells the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) that the [Twilight Dagger](../Items/Mythic%20Items/Twilight%20Dagger.md) is enticing him to kill [Kariil](../../Kariil%20Acquermann.md), the [Twilight Dagger](../Items/Mythic%20Items/Twilight%20Dagger.md)'s past wielder. The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) think up ways to remove the curse without killing [Kariil](../../Kariil%20Acquermann.md).
- [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md) casts legend lore on the [Twilight Dagger](../Items/Mythic%20Items/Twilight%20Dagger.md). [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md) learns that the [Twilight Dagger](../Items/Mythic%20Items/Twilight%20Dagger.md)'s "curse" is not actually a curse, but an immutable property of the weapon. He also learns that [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) and [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md), who owned the [Twilight Dagger](../Items/Mythic%20Items/Twilight%20Dagger.md) for a brief moment, are attuned to other [Mythic Items](../../Mythic%20Items.md) and thus cannot be attuned with the [Twilight Dagger](../Items/Mythic%20Items/Twilight%20Dagger.md).
- [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md)'s legend lore exposes the fact that [Kayriel](../NPCs/Kayriel%20Acquermann.md) wielded the [Twilight Dagger](../Items/Mythic%20Items/Twilight%20Dagger.md) before [Kariil](../../Kariil%20Acquermann.md).
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) discuss the matter with the other people on the [airship](../Items/Quest%20Items/Bloated%20Dragon.md). [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) asks [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md) for her permission to execute [Kariil](../../Kariil%20Acquermann.md). [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md) disapproves, and tells [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) that an [Acquermann](../../Acquermann%20Clan.md) should die with honor. [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md) tells him that [Kariil](../../Kariil%20Acquermann.md) should fight for his life in a fair duel.
- [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md) agrees to the duel. [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md) adds that she knows the place where to hold the duel: the [Acquermann Estate](../Locations/Buildings/Acquermann%20Estate.md) nestled in [Yvernus](../Locations/Areas/Yvernus%20District.md). After the duel, [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md) hopes to find a lead to travel to [Shadowfell](../Locations/Planes/Shadowfell.md).
## [Airship](../Items/Quest%20Items/Bloated%20Dragon.md) Landing
- As the [airship](../Items/Quest%20Items/Bloated%20Dragon.md) lands, [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) notices imploded buildings. Within these buildings [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) sees faint glimmers of light varying in color: blue, white, red and green.
- [Gandour](../../Gandour%20Ironfleet.md) and the airship crew repair the [Bloated Dragon](../Items/Quest%20Items/Bloated%20Dragon.md).
### Bomb-planting crew
- [Nos-Aji](../NPCs/Nos-Aji.md) and [Olrac](../NPCs/Olrac.md) retrieve two barrels of [Gloompowder Bags](../Items/Quest%20Items/Gloompowder%20Bags.md) from the [airship](../Items/Quest%20Items/Bloated%20Dragon.md)'s hold. The two think of a way to stealthily transport the bombs. [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) offers a way by lending her services to [Nos-Aji](../NPCs/Nos-Aji.md) and [Olrac](../NPCs/Olrac.md); [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) and her ancient companion tag along. [Severino](../NPCs/Severino%20Medlin.md) gets acquainted with [Nos-Aji](../NPCs/Nos-Aji.md) and [Olrac](../NPCs/Olrac.md).
### Protection services
- The three [Wycroft](../Locations/Kingdoms/Wycroft%20Mountain%20Kingdom.md) warmages descend the [airship](../Items/Quest%20Items/Bloated%20Dragon.md) and ask for protection while they are casting teleport circles, which will bring the [Wycroft Gladiators](../Factions/Wycroft%20Gladiators.md) into [Yvernus](../Locations/Areas/Yvernus%20District.md). [Thoradin](../PCs/Thoradin%20Goodman.md), [Splix](../PCs/Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md) and [Noah](../PCs/Noah%20Skie.md) accompany the three warmages.
### A duel and a lead
- [Kiris](../PCs/Kiris%20Acquermann.md), [Theobald](../PCs/Theobald%20Clayhollow.md) and [Arc](../PCs/Arc.md) travel to the [Acquermann Estate](../Locations/Buildings/Acquermann%20Estate.md) with [Kariil](../../Kariil%20Acquermann.md), [Kirren](../NPCs/Kirren%20Acquermann.md), [Michaela](../NPCs/Michaela%20Randall.md), and [Leneia](../NPCs/Leneia%20Yarumcy.md). 
## D-d-dragons?
- [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) removes most of the items inside her bag of holding. [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) doffs her armor and entrusts it to [Gandour](../../Gandour%20Ironfleet.md).
- [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) fills the bag of holding with gold and [Gloompowder Bags](../Items/Quest%20Items/Gloompowder%20Bags.md).
- [Nos-Aji](../NPCs/Nos-Aji.md), [Olrac](../NPCs/Olrac.md), [Severino](../NPCs/Severino%20Medlin.md), [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) and [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) stealthily plants bombs near the perimeter of [Yvernus District](../Locations/Areas/Yvernus%20District.md).
- The [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) spots a young blue dragon nest with eggs. [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md)'s ancient companion warns the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md); the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) steer clear from the area.
- [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) and [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) see a red dragon's nest at the center of an imploded housing block. They conclude that the dragons they fought earlier.
- [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) riles up a young green dragon. [Adeena](../PCs/Adeena%20Oberon.md) blows up three of the dragon's eggs during the encounter. [Adikia](../PCs/Adikia%20Unalome.md) restrains the dragon, and the [party](../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) escapes.
