## Description
The [Ironfleet Compound](Ironfleet%20Compound.md) is the residence of the [Ironfleet Clan](../../../Ironfleet%20Clan.md).
### Spacious Warehouse
The warehouse is refurbished into an airship construction hub.
### Place of Worship
An external room where residents of the compound can solemnly pray to their respective deities.
### Dining Hall
This narrow yet long hall serves as the place where members of the [Ironfleet Clan](../../../Ironfleet%20Clan.md) meet. Ever since the [Unbinding of Yvernus](../../Lore/Events/Assault%20on%20Asteri%20and%20Unbinding%20of%20Yvernus.md), the room has been used as a meeting place for the [party](../../Factions/Seven%20Up....md) and their allies. 

The floating yet unmoving [Yvernus](../Areas/Yvernus%20District.md) can be seen from the windows.
