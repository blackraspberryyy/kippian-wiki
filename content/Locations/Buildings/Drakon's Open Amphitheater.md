## Description
The large open area is carved onto the side of a low-lying hill, manifesting its semicircular shape that slopes down. A covered stage is set on the lowest point of the amphitheater. Stone benches provide seating for the attendees.
 
Large gatherings of people are held here. Lacking a dedicated building for political meetings, [Drakon](../Areas/Drakon%20District.md)'s leaders used to convene their meetings here, in front of the public.

Adjacent to the amphitheater is an open tree-lined park. The trees there are old and large, with the oldest and largest boasting a 10-foot wide trunk.
