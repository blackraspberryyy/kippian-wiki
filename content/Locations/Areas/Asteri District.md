## Description
[Asteri](Asteri%20District.md) is [Midelia](../Settlements/Midkip.md)'s noble district. [The High Council of Midkip](../../Factions/The%20High%20Council%20of%20Midkip.md) convenes here.

The district is made of gold, silver, and adorned with gemstones. An Antimagic Field protects the entire district.

The district's interests are represented by [United Kippian](../Kingdoms/Kingdom%20of%20United%20Kippian.md)'s king, [King Riordan](../../../Riordan%20Kyp.md).

Due to the [Assault on Asteri](../../../Assault%20on%20Asteri.md), the district is destroyed, marking an end of [Kippian](../Kingdoms/Kingdom%20of%20United%20Kippian.md)'s stability.
