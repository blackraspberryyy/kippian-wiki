## Description
[Aetos](Aetos%20District.md) is [Midelia](../Settlements/Midkip.md)'s elven district. Located on top of an island delta, the district is separated by the river on all sides. Lush vegetation, mimicking the [Ephelian](../Kingdoms/Elven%20Kingdom%20of%20Ephelus.md) flora covers the structures.
