## Description
[Midelia](../Settlements/Midkip.md)'s westernmost district, [Drakon](Drakon%20District.md), is where rural migrants settle. The district is one of the two outer districts. Farms and ranches are scattered within the district.

[Gokare Veegar](../../NPCs/Gokare%20Veegar.md) serves as the district's [High Council](../../Factions/The%20High%20Council%20of%20Midkip.md) representative.
