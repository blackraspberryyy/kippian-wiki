## Description
The [Aureate Rapier](Aureate%20Rapier.md) is not meant to be used as a weapon. Instead, its merit lies in its undeniable value. Its flawless and enigmatic sheen entices those who see it, and its symbolic importance is enough to capture anyone's attention. In the right hands, or rather on the right terms, the [Aureate Rapier](Aureate%20Rapier.md) can be the perfect asset.
### Mythic Keeper: [Azir Kyp](../../Lore/Mythical%20Heroes/Azir%20Kyp.md)
The [Aureate Rapier](Aureate%20Rapier.md) is a golden ceremonial rapier given to [Kippian](../../Locations/Kingdoms/Kingdom%20of%20United%20Kippian.md)'s royal princes. Its power, which is exploited to its fullest potential by [Azir Kyp](../../Lore/Mythical%20Heroes/Azir%20Kyp.md) during [The Great War](../../Lore/Kippian-Sumber%20War.md), magnifies its wielder's innate charisma.
# Properties
### Chipped Gold
You can sell the chipped gold for 1 gp. You can only do this once per day. A chipped Aureate Rapier deals half its normal damage.

### Alchemical Nature
The Aureate Rapier retained some of its alchemical magic, allowing it to self-mend its chipped parts. Next dawn, the Aureate Rapier is back to its unchipped state.

### Bargaining Chip
You gain advantage on your Charisma checks whenever you use the Chipped Gold as a bargaining asset. In addition, you can now sell the chipped gold for 5 gp.

### Golden Allure
If you are wielding the Aureate Rapier, target one creature who can see this weapon. The target has disadvantage on all Wisdom checks. You can change the target (or targets) of Golden Allure at the start of your next turn.

### Alluring Appearance I
You can now target up to two creatures with Golden Allure.

### Disarming Presence
Choose one enemy creature affected by Golden Allure. You can use your action to impose disadvantage on its next attack roll. In addition, it takes one additional die for the next damage source it would receive. These effects last until the start of your next turn.
