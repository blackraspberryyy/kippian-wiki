### Description
A favored weapon by [Amlaena Gustkil](../../../Amlaena%20Gustkil.md), the Ethereal Ranger, the [Evanescent Shortbow](Evanescent%20Shortbow.md) allows its wielder to meld with the light and become illusory in appearance. Arrows fired from the bow dissipate into thin air, allowing its wielder to be elusive and untraceable in battle.
## Properties
#### Shortbow, +1
You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.

#### Translucence
When placed on glass-like surfaces, the weapon becomes invisible, except to its attuned wielder. Furthermore, nonmagical arrows used as ammunition for this weapon gain the **Translucent** property upon firing. Translucent arrows are invisible, and they dissipate into the ethereal plane after it hits a creature or an object.

#### Ethereal Quiver
You can use your bonus action to draw an Ethereal Arrow from thin air. Ethereal arrows inherently have the Translucent property. Damage dealt by using an ethereal arrow is halved (rounded down). Ethereal arrows cannot be used as ammunition to other weapons, and they will dissipate after 6 seconds when not fired.

#### Luminescence
You can cast the Light and Daylight spells, but with either the shortbow or an Ethereal Arrow as the spell's target. You can only cast Daylight once per long rest.

#### Transparency
You gain advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide. Furthermore, once per long rest, you can use your action to gain the effect of Invisibility spell for one minute.
## Lore Mentions
### Excerpt from **Elven Lore: Stories from the Lost War**
> It was said that [Amlaena](../../../Amlaena%20Gustkil.md)’s shortbow is translucent in sight. Arrows fired from her shortbow evaporate into thin air, making it impossible for the bow and its wielder to be tracked. A weapon that hides its wielder is quite formidable in the right hands.

Her spirit’s fading into the ethereal  
Find it there; light it back home
