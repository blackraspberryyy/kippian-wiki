## Description
The [Frostborn Armor](Frostborn%20Armor.md) is the result of infusing frost magic with the fur of a great beast. Its wearer can freeze the surrounding moisture into solid ice, making the armor impervious to physical attacks.
### Mythic Keeper: [Spekid Frostborn](../../Lore/Mythical%20Heroes/Spekid%20Frostborn.md)
Fashioned by [Spekid Frostborn](../../Lore/Mythical%20Heroes/Spekid%20Frostborn.md) from the fur of a mythical bear endemic to [Stonethorn Mountains](../../Locations/Areas/Stonethorn%20Mountains.md), the [Frostborn Armor](Frostborn%20Armor.md) provides an icy, magical defense to its wearer.
# Properties
## Frost Magic Infusion
The Frostborn Armor is enchanted to resist cold. You can withstand temperatures as low as -50 degrees Fahrenheit without any additional protection. You also have resistance to cold damage.
## Sorcerer Affinity
A sorcerer can cast spells while wearing Frostborn Armor as if they are proficient with it.
## Frost Shield II
When you are hit by an attack, you can use your reaction to create an ice-like barrier to protect yourself or an ally from damage. Until the start of your next turn, you have a +4 bonus to AC, including against the triggering attack. In addition, if an ally creature within 5 feet is hit by an attack, you can use your reaction to use Frost Shield on that allied creature. 
This consumes one Frost Charge.
## Frost Charge II
Frostborn Armor can contain up to 6 Frost Charges. It regains 1d6 expended Frost Charges daily at dawn.
