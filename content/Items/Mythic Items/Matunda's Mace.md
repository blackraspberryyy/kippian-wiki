## Description
[Matunda's Mace](Matunda's%20Mace.md) is imbued with the power of [Matunda](../../Deities/Old%20Gods/Matunda.md), the elder goddess who holds dominion over death and life. Kept by [Yugad](../../Lore/Mythical%20Heroes/Yugad%20Matunda.md) during [The Great War](../../Lore/Kippian-Sumber%20War.md), [Matunda's Mace](Matunda's%20Mace.md) grants its wielder the power to be a threat to enemies and a boon to allies.
### Mythic Keeper: [Yugad Matunda](../../Lore/Mythical%20Heroes/Yugad%20Matunda.md)
[Matunda's Mace](Matunda's%20Mace.md) is a weapon wielded by [Yugad Matunda](../../Lore/Mythical%20Heroes/Yugad%20Matunda.md) during [The Great War](../../Lore/Kippian-Sumber%20War.md). The mace is powered by sapping the life essence of enemies or by channeling divine power.
# Properties
## Mace, +1
You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.
## Soul Charge
The maximum amount of soul charges the mace can contain is equal to your character's level. You gain soul charges in two ways:
- **Soul Rend.** Whenever you successfully hit an enemy creature with this weapon, you gain one soul charge.
- **Divine Sacrifice.** You channel your divine power to imbue Matunda's Mace with soul charges. You can expend a use of your Channel Divinity to gain soul charges. Using your action, you gain the maximum amount of soul charges. You can only use this Channel Divinity option once per long rest.
## Soul Transfusion II
As an action, you spend soul charges to restore you or your ally's hit points by three times the amount of soul charges spent (3 hp per spent soul charge). You can choose creatures within 30 feet of you and divide the hit points among them.
## Essence Removal
Whenever you successfully hit an enemy creature with this weapon, instead of gaining a soul charge, you spend soul charges to damage an enemy creature. You deal necrotic damage equal to the amount of soul charges spent.
