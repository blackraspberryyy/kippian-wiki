### Description
[Matunda's Mace](Matunda's%20Mace.md) is imbued with the power of [Matunda](../../Deities/Old%20Gods/Matunda.md), the elder goddess that holds dominion over death and life. Kept by [Yugad](../../../Yugad%20Matunda.md) during [The Great War](../../Lore/Kippian-Sumber%20War.md), [Matunda's Mace](Matunda's%20Mace.md) allows its wielder to be a threat to enemies and a boon to allies.
## Properties
#### Mace, +1
You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.

#### Soul Charge
The maximum amount of soul charges the mace can contain is equal to your character's level. You gain soul charges in two ways:
- **Soul Rend.** Whenever you successfully hit an enemy creature with this weapon, you gain one soul charge.
- **Divine Sacrifice.** You channel your divine power to imbue Matunda's Mace with soul charges. You can expend a use of your Channel Divinity to gain soul charges. Using your action, you gain the maximum amount of soul charges. You can only use this Channel Divinity option once per long rest.

#### Soul Transfusion II
As an action, you spend soul charges to restore you or your ally's hit points by three times the amount of soul charges spent (3 hp per spent soul charge). You can choose creatures within 30 feet of you and divide the hit points among them.

#### Essence Removal
Whenever you successfully hit an enemy creature with this weapon, instead of gaining a soul charge, you spend soul charges to damage an enemy creature. You deal necrotic damage equal to the amount of soul charges spent.
## Lore Mentions
### Excerpt from **Collected Learnings from Yugad Matunda**
>Death and life are not the same thing, but to separate one from the other is a folly—a shortsighted and self-serving perspective. There is no other way around it: to bring forth death is to raise life. This amalgamation of death and life is central to understanding true divine power; a hard, unconscionable truth, but a truth nonetheless.

### Excerpt from **Touched by the Divine**
>While most orders dismiss [Matunda](../../Deities/Old%20Gods/Matunda.md)’s teaching as either barbaric or paradoxical, it nevertheless had an undeniable influence on the discourse of divine power. It was due to [Yugad Matunda](../../../Yugad%20Matunda.md)'s brazen belief that allowed for the possibility of non-traditional access to divine power.
