## Description
The [Evershift](Evershift.md) is a sword of intricate dwarven design and ingenuity. Internal counterweight mechanisms allow the sword to shift its apparent weight, making it unwieldy to the uninitiated but a fearsome weapon to a trained one. Finally, [Mathudim](../../Lore/Mythical%20Heroes/Mathudim%20Strongbolt.md)'s design renders the [Evershift](Evershift.md) durable and protected to disassembly, as if a magic weapon.
### Mythic Keeper: [Mathudim Strongbolt](../../Lore/Mythical%20Heroes/Mathudim%20Strongbolt.md)
