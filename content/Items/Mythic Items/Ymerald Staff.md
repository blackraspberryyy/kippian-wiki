### Description
Recovered from the infinitely-deep [Lake of Shimmers](../../Locations/Areas/Lake%20of%20Shimmers.md), the [Ymerald Staff](Ymerald%20Staff.md) serves as a reminder of the insane spellcasting prowess that [Zerrus Zagi](../../../Zerrus%20Zagi.md) brought during [The Great War](../../Lore/Kippian-Sumber%20War.md). The emerald-tipped staff allows its wielder to hurl evocation spells with both fury and ease.
## Properties
#### Ymerald Blessing
The Ymerald Staff holds a curious power. You can prepare one additional evocation spell.

#### Opidian Quarterstaff
This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.

#### Zagi's Ferocity
The Ymerald Staff imparts a cantrip from Zagi's spell repertoire. After a long rest, choose an evocation cantrip from the wizard's spell list that you have not learned. You can cast that cantrip while holding this staff. The effect lasts until you take a long rest.

#### Evoker Staff I
While holding the Ymerald Staff, you gain +1 save DC for evocation spells, and a +1 bonus to evocation spell attack rolls.
## Lore Mentions
### Excerpt from the Magi of Opidys
>*"Magus [Zagi](../../../Zerrus%20Zagi.md) is worth a whole army. If need be, give in to his demands. We have a war to win."*

> For a time [Zerrus Zagi](../../../Zerrus%20Zagi.md) was known to be a mad wizard. Kippians were wary of the Opidians and their magic: it was irregular, and in some cases even cultic. [Zagi](../../../Zerrus%20Zagi.md) was the Grand Magus of [Opidys](../../Locations/Kingdoms/Opidys.md), and mages from [Kippian](../../Locations/Kingdoms/Kingdom%20of%20United%20Kippian.md) who dared to subdue [Zagi](../../../Zerrus%20Zagi.md) went back humbled by the Opidian mage.
>
>But the great war came, and the elven leaders of [Ephelus](../../Locations/Kingdoms/Elven%20Kingdom%20of%20Ephelus.md) decided to seek the help of the Opidians. Through [King Agustus](../../../Agustus%20Kyp.md), [Zagi](../../../Zerrus%20Zagi.md) gained [Opidys](../../Locations/Kingdoms/Opidys.md) its sovereignty in exchange for his service in the war. There were doubts, especially from the elven war-mages, but the moment [Zagi](../../../Zerrus%20Zagi.md) descended from the [Kippian](../../Locations/Kingdoms/Kingdom%20of%20United%20Kippian.md) ship, the tides of war began to shift. All doubts were erased: the [Ymerald](../../Locations/Settlements/Ymerald.md) Evoker was worth much, much more than what he had bargained for.
