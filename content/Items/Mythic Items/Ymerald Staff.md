## Description
Recovered from the infinitely-deep [Lake of Shimmers](../../Locations/Areas/Lake%20of%20Shimmers.md), the [Ymerald Staff](Ymerald%20Staff.md) is an arcane focus composed of a seemingly innocuous emerald gemstone affixed on top of a cane-sized driftwood. Imbued with otherworldly power, the [Opidian Staff](Ymerald%20Staff.md) transforms the keeper's latent arcane energy into powerful evoking magic. With enough power, it can call on meteors to decimate the battlefield.
### Mythic Keeper: [Zerrus Zagi](../../Lore/Mythical%20Heroes/Zerrus%20Zagi.md)
The [Ymerald Staff](Ymerald%20Staff.md) serves as a reminder of the insane spellcasting prowess that [Zerrus Zagi](../../Lore/Mythical%20Heroes/Zerrus%20Zagi.md) brought during [The Great War](../../Lore/Kippian-Sumber%20War.md). The emerald-tipped staff allowed [Zagi](../../Lore/Mythical%20Heroes/Zerrus%20Zagi.md) to cast evocation spells with fury and ease.
# Properties
## Ymerald Blessing
The Ymerald Staff holds a curious power. You can prepare one additional evocation spell.
## Opidian Quarterstaff
This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.
## Zagi's Ferocity
The Ymerald Staff imparts a cantrip from Zagi's spell repertoire. After a long rest, choose an evocation cantrip from the wizard's spell list that you have not learned. You can cast that cantrip while holding this staff. The effect lasts until you take a long rest.
## Evoker Staff I
While holding the Ymerald Staff, you gain +1 save DC for evocation spells, and a +1 bonus to evocation spell attack rolls.
