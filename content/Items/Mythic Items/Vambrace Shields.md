## Description
[Cappodon](../../Lore/Mythical%20Heroes/Johannes%20Cappodon.md)'s [Vambrace Shields](Vambrace%20Shields.md) are the ultimate defensive equipment. They offer a limited offensive option, but the protection the pair of shields gives its wearer and their allies is invaluable in any encounter.
### Mythic Keeper: [Johannes Cappodon](../../Lore/Mythical%20Heroes/Johannes%20Cappodon.md)
Worn by [Johannes Cappodon](../../Lore/Mythical%20Heroes/Johannes%20Cappodon.md) during [The Great War](../../Lore/Kippian-Sumber%20War.md), the adamantium-alloyed and battle-worn [Vambrace Shields](Vambrace%20Shields.md) provided unflinching defense to the general and his army during the war.
