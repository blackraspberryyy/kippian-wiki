### Description
Worn by [Johannes Cappodon](../../../Johannes%20Cappodon.md) during [The Great War](../../Lore/Kippian-Sumber%20War.md), the adamantium-alloyed and battle-worn [Vambrace Shields](Vambrace%20Shields.md) provide unflinching defense to anyone who wields them.
## Properties
#### Shield, +1
While holding both shields, you have a +1 bonus to AC. This bonus is in addition to the shield's normal bonus to AC.

#### Shield Attack III
On a hit, the Vambrace Shield deals 1d8 bludgeoning damage.

#### Shieldbearer
To harness the Vambrace Shields' enchantment, you must defer using any other weapon. In order to receive the shield's AC bonus and to use its properties, you must be wielding both Vambrace Shields.

#### Shield Attack Proficiency
You can now attack with the Vambrace Shields as if you are proficient with it. In addition, if you use Shield Attack as an action, you can use your bonus action to shove a creature within 5 feet of you.

#### Shield Wall
As an action, you can provide protection to yourself and a chosen ally creature within 5 feet. Creatures attacking you or your ally receive disadvantage on their attack rolls until the start of your next turn.

#### Proactive Defense
You can use your reaction to provide this item's total AC bonus to another creature within 15 feet that is targeted by an attack.
## Lore Mentions
### Excerpt from **Chronicles of the Kippian-Sumber War**
>*“That man is not a fighter… That man is a protector—and if he is loyal to a cause, a reliable ally. Release him, and bring him to me. I have yet to find a man as unyielding as that gladiator.”*
>
>–[King Agustus Kyp](../../../Agustus%20Kyp.md)
>
>Even when he was just a gladiator, [Johannes Cappodon](../../../Johannes%20Cappodon.md) never had an inclination to an aggressive way of fighting. Armed with a singular buckler and a dull blade, he defended and wore down his opponents. His bouts were feats of stamina—his enemies conceding due to fatigue, with Johannes outlasting all fighters in the arena.
>
>One summer night, the audience was understandably bored waiting for Johannes’ protracted duel to end. However, a young prince seated in the royal balcony was delighted about the warrior’s inane display of defense. That prince soon became King [Agustus Kyp](../../../Agustus%20Kyp.md), and he brought with him the loyal gladiator who became one of the most important figures of the great [Kippian-Sumber War](../../Lore/Kippian-Sumber%20War.md)
