### Excerpt from **Engor's Diary**
> A strange man came. He said, in his ever-chilling voice, that he came from the frozen north, in the deadly mountains of Stonethorn. The mysterious man wears a thick bear pelt, yet today is one hot summer day. His glum mask finishes his daring outfit. I’ll spare you the details of my inquiries, but assuredly his unabashed appearance caught me off guard. Here’s a stranger who seeks war, and not away from it. I’d have let him had he entered the army’s arcanists, but he stubbornly refused. He wants to meet the king. But to not draw his mask? A royal guard, getting as impatient as I was, closed in and warned the stranger. He did not budge. Several warnings ensued, followed by the royal guards forming a circle around him. I did not stop them, yet if I had known what would happen I should have spared them the embarrassment.
> 
> The guards thrust their spear into his puffed chest. At the moment of impact, that part of the hide armor becomes covered in hardened ice. The guards could not strike him; even attempts to hit him where the armor ends were blocked by a conjured shield-like ice. Attacking him was fruitless, and I was left with no choice.
> 
>Here is a man, from the wicked north, with astonishing frost magic. This man is asking to serve and to die for a matter that does not concern him. The king, who was understandably angered by this unwelcome intrusion, later in the day met me with a grateful tone, for he now commands a loyal sorcerer that he deems “as hard as ice, both in nature and in power”.
