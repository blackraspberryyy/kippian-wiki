##### Known for: a mace imbued with the power of [Matunda](../Deities/Old%20Gods/Matunda.md)
### Description
## Lore Mentions
### Excerpt from **Collected Learnings from Yugad Matunda**
>Death and life are not the same thing, but to separate one from the other is a folly—a shortsighted and self-serving perspective. There is no other way around it: to bring forth death is to raise life. This amalgamation of death and life is central to understanding true divine power; a hard, unconscionable truth, but a truth nonetheless.

### Excerpt from **Touched by the Divine**
>While most orders dismiss [Matunda](../Deities/Old%20Gods/Matunda.md)’s teaching as either barbaric or paradoxical, it nevertheless had an undeniable influence on the discourse of divine power. It was due to Yugad Matunda’s brazen belief that allowed for the possibility of non-traditional access to divine power.
