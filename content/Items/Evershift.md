### Excerpt from **Champions of Wycroft**
>[Mathudim](../../Mathudim.md) dragged the cumbersome [Evershift](Evershift.md) into the battlefield; the gigantic, mechanical sword looked more of a burden than a weapon. But when Mathudim swung the Evershift, the rationale behind its design became clear: the hefty sword provided Mathudim with ferocious momentum. He swung it upwards, and with it Mathudim was launched into the air; he swung it forwards and he moved swiftly towards the enemy ranks. And he spun and spun, cutting enemies within Mathudim’s reach.
