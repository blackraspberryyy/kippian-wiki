## Description
_Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a sorcerer)_
 
A locket bearing the [Wayravens](../Factions/Knights%20of%20the%20Wayraven.md)' sigil. You can use the locket as a spellcasting focus while you hold or wear it.

When you use a Metamagic option on a spell while you are holding or wearing the locket, you can momentarily curse one creature targeted by the spell; choose one ability score, and until the end of your next turn, the creature has disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws that use that ability.
