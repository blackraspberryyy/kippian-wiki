[Professor Embersense](Dorfir%20Embersense.md) and his apprentice, [Fiamil](Fiamil%20Underwood.md), are currently researching an ancient structure resurfacing from the sea. [Splix](Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md) suggests a destination to [Gandour](Gandour%20Ironfleet.md), and the latter accepts.
- [Session 50](../Session%20Log/Session%2050.md): The flight proves uneventful, which was good news to the [party](Seven%20Up....md). However, the [Bloated Dragon](Bloated%20Dragon.md) is slow.
- [Session 51](../Session%20Log/Session%2051.md): [Adeena](Adeena%20Oberon.md) asks [Dorfir Embersense](Dorfir%20Embersense.md) about a spell that could protect the [Bloated Dragon](Bloated%20Dragon.md) from magical attacks.

The [party](Seven%20Up....md) informs him that the district is devastated during the [Assault on Asteri](Assault%20on%20Asteri%20and%20Unbinding%20of%20Yvernus.md).
- [Session 51](../Session%20Log/Session%2051.md): The [party](Seven%20Up....md) realizes that the [Bloated Dragon](Bloated%20Dragon.md) is nowhere to be found.

- [Session 52](../Session%20Log/Session%2052.md): The [Bloated Dragon](Bloated%20Dragon.md) descends, and [Gandour Ironfleet](Gandour%20Ironfleet.md) meets them. He explains that the [party](Seven%20Up....md) was gone for nearly two days. The [party](Seven%20Up....md) concludes that entering the [Library](Sunken%20Library.md) must have induced another temporal anomaly.
- [Session 52](../Session%20Log/Session%2052.md): The [party](Seven%20Up....md) notices that [Gandour](Gandour%20Ironfleet.md) is hiding something. [Gandour](Gandour%20Ironfleet.md), upon being questioned, tells the [party](Seven%20Up....md) that they must not judge him. They ascend on the [Bloated Dragon](Bloated%20Dragon.md)'s lower deck and see [Janna Furwish](Janna%20Furwish.md) waiting for them.
