### Description
## Lore Mentions
### Excerpt from **Elven Lore: Stories from the Lost War**
> It was said that Amlaena Gustkil’s shortbow is translucent in sight. Arrows fired from her shortbow evaporate into thin air, making it impossible for the bow and its wielder to be tracked. A weapon that hides its wielder is quite formidable in the right hands.
