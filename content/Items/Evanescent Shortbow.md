### Description
## Lore Mentions
### Excerpt from **Elven Lore: Stories from the Lost War**
> It was said that [Amlaena](../../Amlaena%20Gustkil.md)’s shortbow is translucent in sight. Arrows fired from her shortbow evaporate into thin air, making it impossible for the bow and its wielder to be tracked. A weapon that hides its wielder is quite formidable in the right hands.

Her spirit’s fading into the ethereal  
Find it there; light it back home
