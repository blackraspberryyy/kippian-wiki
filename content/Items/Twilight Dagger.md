### Excerpt from **Infamous: Dangerous Rogues**
>[Kwonyr](../../Kwonyr.md), the self-proclaimed Queen of Rogues, wielded the *[Twilight Dagger](Twilight%20Dagger.md)* during her reign. Accounts of those lucky enough to escape Kwonyr report that the dagger is a separate, malevolent entity: the dagger was the manifestation of the shadows, and through it Kwonyr became master of the dark.
