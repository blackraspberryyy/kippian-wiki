## Description
A gladiator turned general, [Johannes Cappodon](Johannes%20Cappodon.md) is hailed as the most indomitable hero of the [Kippian-Sumber War](../Kippian-Sumber%20War.md). Clad in all-defensive gear, the general is able to protect whole retinues from ambushes and untoward attacks. His heroic deeds earned him the fitting designation as the [Shield of Kippian](Johannes%20Cappodon.md).
### Keeper of the [Vambrace Shields](../../Items/Mythic%20Items/Vambrace%20Shields.md)
[United Kippian](../../Locations/Kingdoms/Kingdom%20of%20United%20Kippian.md)'s most celebrated war general, [Johannes Cappodon](Johannes%20Cappodon.md), donned the [Vambrace Shields](../../Items/Mythic%20Items/Vambrace%20Shields.md), a singular combination that allowed him unrivaled protection on the battlefield. But the reasoning behind dual-wielding shields was not to protect himself; more importantly for him, it was a tool to defend his allies. It was an unusual way of leading an army, but being under the general's protection provided security and morale to his companions.
### Legacy
The seventh month, Cappodon, is named after [Johannes Cappodon](Johannes%20Cappodon.md).
# Lore Mentions
## Excerpt from **Chronicles of the [Kippian-Sumber War](../Kippian-Sumber%20War.md)**
>*“That man is not a fighter… That man is a protector—and if he is loyal to a cause, a reliable ally. Release him, and bring him to me. I have yet to find a man as unyielding as that gladiator.”*
>
>–[King Agustus Kyp](../../../Agustus%20Kyp.md)

>Even when he was just a gladiator, [Johannes Cappodon](Johannes%20Cappodon.md) never had an inclination to an aggressive way of fighting. Armed with a singular buckler and a dull blade, he defended and wore down his opponents. His bouts were feats of stamina—his enemies conceding due to fatigue, with Johannes outlasting all fighters in the arena.
>
>One summer night, the audience was understandably bored waiting for Johannes’ protracted duel to end. However, a young prince seated in the royal balcony was delighted about the warrior’s inane display of defense. That prince soon became King [Agustus Kyp](../../../Agustus%20Kyp.md), and he brought with him the loyal gladiator who became one of the most important figures of the great [Kippian-Sumber War](../Kippian-Sumber%20War.md)
