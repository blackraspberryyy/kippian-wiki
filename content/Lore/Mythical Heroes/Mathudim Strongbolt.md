## Description
[Mathudim Strongbolt](Mathudim%20Strongbolt.md) hails from the dwarven kingdom of [Wycroft](../../Locations/Kingdoms/Wycroft%20Mountain%20Kingdom.md). His forefathers were master blacksmiths, and [Mathudim](Mathudim%20Strongbolt.md) prepped himself to be the best one. He mastered the smith early on and was considered a prodigy in this regard. [Mathudim](Mathudim%20Strongbolt.md) built his own collection of armor, shields, and weapons. On his free time, he practiced wielding all kinds of weapons.

Due to his smithing prowess, [Mathudim](Mathudim%20Strongbolt.md)'s involvement in the war was required. [Mathudim](Mathudim%20Strongbolt.md) was first appointed as a warsmith: a smith capable of mending, smithing, and crafting all kinds of weapons, armors, and shields. He perfected weapon smithing while the great tides of wars were raging.
### Keeper of the [Evershift](../../Items/Mythic%20Items/Evershift.md)
[The Great War](../Kippian-Sumber%20War.md) dragged on for years and [Mathudim](Mathudim%20Strongbolt.md) and his dwarven kin diminished. Once, in an overland assault, [Mathudim](Mathudim%20Strongbolt.md) was forced to wield a curious weapon of his own making: the [Evershift](../../Items/Mythic%20Items/Evershift.md). On the battlefield [Mathudim](Mathudim%20Strongbolt.md) and the [Evershift](../../Items/Mythic%20Items/Evershift.md) proved to be an unstoppable combination. He quickly rose through the ranks and became touted as the [Weaponmaster](Mathudim%20Strongbolt.md). And the [Evershift](../../Items/Mythic%20Items/Evershift.md) proves to be the pinnacle, albeit also the most unwieldy, of [Mathudim](Mathudim%20Strongbolt.md)'s many formidable creations.
### Legacy
The first month, [Mathudim](Mathudim%20Strongbolt.md), is named after [Mathudim Strongbolt](Mathudim%20Strongbolt.md)

## Excerpt from **Champions of Wycroft**
>[Mathudim](Mathudim%20Strongbolt.md) dragged the cumbersome [Evershift](../../Items/Mythic%20Items/Evershift.md) into the battlefield; the gigantic, mechanical sword looked more of a burden than a weapon. But when [Mathudim](Mathudim%20Strongbolt.md) swung the [Evershift](../../Items/Mythic%20Items/Evershift.md), the rationale behind its design became clear: the hefty sword provided [Mathudim](Mathudim%20Strongbolt.md) with ferocious momentum. He swung it upwards, and with it [Mathudim](Mathudim%20Strongbolt.md) was launched into the air; he swung it forwards and he moved swiftly towards the enemy ranks. And he spun and spun, cutting enemies within [Mathudim](Mathudim%20Strongbolt.md)’s reach.
