## Description
During the far-reaching events of [The Great War](../Kippian-Sumber%20War.md), the half-elven rogue [Kwonyr](Kwonyr%20Karst.md) developed a legendary notoriety among rogues. The [Queen of Rogues](Kwonyr%20Karst.md) employed her reputation not to gather riches, but to safeguard women during the war. It was due to her notorious deeds that innocent women were relatively unharmed during the war. The name [Kwonyr](Kwonyr%20Karst.md) still strikes fear into the hearts of even the most dangerous men.
### Keeper of the [Twilight Dagger](../../Items/Mythic%20Items/Twilight%20Dagger.md)
[Kwonyr](Kwonyr%20Karst.md) became attuned with the powers of [Shadowfell](../../Locations/Planes/Shadowfell.md) through the [Twilight Dagger](../../Items/Mythic%20Items/Twilight%20Dagger.md). It is said that she sends her crepuscular dagger to notorious abusers—a declaration nothing short of a death sentence. The dagger, it seems, always finds a way back to its mistress.
### Legacy
The fifth month, Kwonyr, is named after [Kwonyr Karst](Kwonyr%20Karst.md).

## Excerpt from **Infamous: Dangerous Rogues**
>[Kwonyr](Kwonyr%20Karst.md), the self-proclaimed [Queen of Rogues](Kwonyr%20Karst.md), wielded the *[Twilight Dagger](../../Items/Mythic%20Items/Twilight%20Dagger.md)* during her reign. Accounts of those lucky enough to escape [Kwonyr](Kwonyr%20Karst.md) report that the dagger is a separate, malevolent entity: the dagger was the manifestation of the shadows, and through it [Kwonyr](Kwonyr%20Karst.md) became master of the dark.
