## Description
The desert nomads of [Opidys](../../Locations/Kingdoms/Opidys.md) are known for their reckless and aggressive use of arcane power. [Zerrus Zagi](Zerrus%20Zagi.md), the [Grand Magus of Opidys](Zerrus%20Zagi.md), was said to be the epitome of an Opidian mage. His arcane mastery garnered enough reputation even among the high elven mages of [Ephelus](../../Locations/Kingdoms/Elven%20Kingdom%20of%20Ephelus.md) who were considered to be the authority on all forms of magic.

During [The Great War](../Kippian-Sumber%20War.md), [King Agustus](../../../Agustus%20Kyp.md) bid for the service of the [Grand Magus](Zerrus%20Zagi.md) in exchange for the liberation of the lands of [Opidys](../../Locations/Kingdoms/Opidys.md). It was an unpopular decision, but it soon proved to be the correct one: [Zerrus Zagi](Zerrus%20Zagi.md) returned to [Kippian](../../Locations/Continents/Kippian.md) a hero, and in time a loyal ally, of the [King of United Kippian](../../../Agustus%20Kyp.md) and its people.
### Keeper of the [Ymerald Staff](../../Items/Mythic%20Items/Ymerald%20Staff.md)
[Zagi](Zerrus%20Zagi.md) was able to call on the power of the skies and stars by channeling his arcane energy through the [Ymerald Staff](../../Items/Mythic%20Items/Ymerald%20Staff.md). The [Ymerald Staff](../../Items/Mythic%20Items/Ymerald%20Staff.md), which was found deep within the [Lake of Shimmers](../../Locations/Areas/Lake%20of%20Shimmers.md), was imbued with great power both earthly and otherworldly. Only [Zagi](Zerrus%20Zagi.md) had the strength and wits to control such maddening power. During [The Great War](../Kippian-Sumber%20War.md), it became obvious that [Zerrus Zagi](Zerrus%20Zagi.md), the [Ymerald Evoker](Zerrus%20Zagi.md), is among the greatest wizards who have ever lived.
### Legacy
The sixth month, Zagi, is named after [Zerrus Zagi](Zerrus%20Zagi.md).
# Lore Mentions
## Excerpt from the Magi of [Opidys](../../Locations/Kingdoms/Opidys.md)
>*"Magus [Zagi](Zerrus%20Zagi.md) is worth a whole army. If need be, give in to his demands. We have a war to win."*
>
> –King [Agustus Kyp](../../../Agustus%20Kyp.md)
> 
> For a time [Zerrus Zagi](Zerrus%20Zagi.md) was known to be a mad wizard. Kippians were wary of the Opidians and their magic: it was irregular, and in some cases even cultic. [Zagi](Zerrus%20Zagi.md) was the Grand Magus of [Opidys](../../Locations/Kingdoms/Opidys.md), and mages from all over [Kippian](../../Locations/Kingdoms/Kingdom%20of%20United%20Kippian.md) who dared to subdue [Zagi](Zerrus%20Zagi.md) went back humbled by the Opidian mage.
>
>But the great war came, and the elven leaders of [Ephelus](../../Locations/Kingdoms/Elven%20Kingdom%20of%20Ephelus.md) decided to seek the help of the Opidians. Through [King Agustus](../../../Agustus%20Kyp.md), [Zagi](Zerrus%20Zagi.md) gained [Opidys](../../Locations/Kingdoms/Opidys.md) its sovereignty in exchange for his service in the war. There were doubts, especially from the elven warmages, but the moment [Zagi](Zerrus%20Zagi.md) descended from the [Kippian](../../Locations/Kingdoms/Kingdom%20of%20United%20Kippian.md) ship, the tide of war began to shift. All doubts were erased: the [Ymerald Evoker](Zerrus%20Zagi.md) was worth much, much more than what he had bargained for.
