### Excerpt from the **Chronicles of Deities**
_“It was said that in ancient times, at the end of the Age of Beasts, Miledu deceived and corrupted Kortusk, son of the orc god Macchi. Kortusk, believing that his brother Gorbogi was trying to usurp their father, killed him in his sleep. This grave offense was not tolerated by the gods, and thus, Akenatun, the sun-god, the all-creator, banished Macchi to guard the underground prison of Miledu as penance for his son’s actions. Macchi was then expelled from the Pantheon of the Old Gods._

_A worse fate awaited Kortusk and his brood. Kortusk’s body and soul was severed from the other. His body was cursed to never decay, and was locked and buried deep underground, never to be found again. His soul was fractured and was forced to invade the souls of his descendants. Kortusk, consumed by hatred, tormented his followers to destroy every other living being until they died. Such was the curse of Kortusk’s progeny. Pantheon of the Old Gods believed that that would be the end of Kortusk and his evil deeds._

_Miledu, however, anticipated the plan. He had planted a cursed seed inside Kortusk’s body before his demise. The seed consumed the body, transforming the non-decaying matter to lifeless orc vessels. When the last of the old progeny of Kortusk perished, the fractured souls of the fallen god bound to the fully-formed orcs inside the cursed body. These new [Kortusk Orcs](../Factions/Kortusk%20Orcs.md) were born with such hatred and destruction, and nothing else. After some time, they finally surfaced and began to ravage the once peaceful land._

_And thus began the [Age of Orcs](../Events/Age%20of%20Orcs.md).”_
