## Description
Serving in the [United Kippian Military](../Factions/United%20Kippian%20Military.md) develops long-lasting relationships between comrades. Bestowing an [Enchor's Arrowhead](../Items/Enchor's%20Arrowhead.md) to a companion is an act that deepens the bond between the bestower and the recipient.

Losing the arrowhead might mean one of two things: the recipient severs the relationship with the bestower; or, the arrowhead is used in the field.
