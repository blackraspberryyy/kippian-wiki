## Description
### Class: Fighter
### Subclass: [Arcane Archer](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/fighter:arcane-archer)
## Backstory
[Noah Skie](Noah%20Skie.md) is a cheerful yet fearless woman residing in a town near [Curkip](../Locations/Settlements/Curkip.md). She was part of the [Kippian Military](../Factions/United%20Kippian%20Military.md) who traveled to [Suirsya](../Locations/Continents/Suirsya.md). There, she was promoted to a scout because of her ability to adapt to different situations. She doesn't back down from any missions her officer gave her. She does everything with precision and proficiency.

[Noah](Noah%20Skie.md) was born into a rich family in [Ankor](../Locations/Settlements/Ankor.md). The Skies own a part of the river in which they provide leases for fishermen to rent. [Norman Skie](../../Norman%20Skie.md), her father, also collects taxes from them, but he tweaks the prices a little bit higher for his personal gain. [Norman](../../Norman%20Skie.md) is so focused on his business that [Noah](Noah%20Skie.md) barely sees him at home; and for good reason, as he does not see [Noah](Noah%20Skie.md) worthy of being his child. He had hoped for a son to carry their family name, but instead, she got a daughter in [Noah](Noah%20Skie.md). And for [Norman Skie](../../Norman%20Skie.md), a woman is lesser than a man.

On the bright side, her mother, [Sophia Skie](../../Sophia%20Skie.md), is but a simple housewife who takes care of the house and the food they eat. She became [Noah](Noah%20Skie.md)’s refuge while growing up, especially when [Norman](../../Norman%20Skie.md) scoffs and mocks her. Because of her, [Noah](Noah%20Skie.md) knows how great it is to be loved and cared for by a mother.

Time passed by and [Noah](Noah%20Skie.md) grew, and more so did her enmity she had for her father. On her 18th name day, as the family was eating dinner, her mother asked Noah what to do for the next part of her life.

_“They are looking for barmaids in [Curkip](../Locations/Settlements/Curkip.md),”_ [Norman](../../Norman%20Skie.md) sarcastically said with a taunting grin. 

[Noah](Noah%20Skie.md), who had enough of his belittling ever since she was a child, answered back: _“And what does that have to do with me?”_

She stood up teary-eyed and looked directly into her father’s eyes. 

_“Why do you think so lowly of me, father? Ever since I was a little girl, you have always belittled me. You have implied that I’m useless, just because I was a girl. You said that if I was a boy, things would be a lot better. You even gave me a boy’s name!”_  She dropped her cutlery to the table as if she was not interested in celebrating her name day anymore. She bolted to her room and returned with a sack full of clothes and some of her personal items. She wiped her tears and stood firmly.

_“You wanted a soldier. That’s what you always wanted, right? Fine. I am going to Curkip and train with the [Kippian Military](../Factions/United%20Kippian%20Military.md). I’ll prove to you what I'm worth.”_

[Noah](Noah%20Skie.md) went to [Curkip](../Locations/Settlements/Curkip.md) to train with the group of soldiers and fighters leaving for [Suirsya](../Locations/Continents/Suirsya.md). She quickly adapted to training and excelled at everything, specifically with bows. It was an innate skill of hers that she never knew before. She was so precise with the weapon that the officers had no choice but to shortlist her into being a candidate for the scouting unit, where having a ranged fighter is advantageous. [Noah](Noah%20Skie.md) was determined to be one of them, and had a bit of an edge as she was the best with the bow from the new recruits. 

During this training, she met [Agatha](../../Agatha.md). [Noah](Noah%20Skie.md) and [Agatha](../../Agatha.md) complemented each other. They are both cheerful and optimistic, but brave and strong. [Agatha](../../Agatha.md) was proficient with swords while Noah was best in ranged weapons. They shared stories from their backgrounds: [Noah](Noah%20Skie.md) was from a rich house while [Agatha](../../Agatha.md) used to live on the street. Both wanted to prove that they are worth something. Soon they became the best of friends. They promised that, if they were accepted in the same unit, they would protect each other.

There were only five soldiers selected among all the recruits for the scout promotion. [Noah](Noah%20Skie.md) and [Agatha](../../Agatha.md) were the top two selected from the newest class.

Time went by and the two completed many missions, albeit mostly easy ones. Then, after proving that they can be entrusted with harder missions, [Noah](Noah%20Skie.md) and [Agatha](../../Agatha.md) were sent to the elite scouting party of the [Kippian Military](../Factions/United%20Kippian%20Military.md) in [Suirsya](../Locations/Continents/Suirsya.md). The party’s mission is to find a route south through the seemingly unsurvivable jungles and mountains of Western [Suirsya](../Locations/Continents/Suirsya.md). [Noah](Noah%20Skie.md) and [Agatha](../../Agatha.md), with three scout veterans, were now traveling through uncharted territory. They were expected to be gone a month and a half at most.

After two weeks, the military lost communication with the party, which was expected. However, two months went by and there were no signs that the party was returning. Then after the third month since the party’s departure, the officers at base camp lost hope and presumed the party died on the mission. Then, one hot summer day, a dazed [Noah](Noah%20Skie.md) wandered into the camp.

[Noah](Noah%20Skie.md) felt lost and alone. [Noah](Noah%20Skie.md) claimed that the majority of the party was slaughtered mercilessly by a jungle tribe and that [Agatha](../../Agatha.md) fell into a deep ravine. [Noah](Noah%20Skie.md) could not remember specific details, but she blamed herself for the whole incident. She told her officers that she was the reason why [Agatha](../../Agatha.md) did not make it home, along with the rest of the party. The bloodshed she witnessed made her fragile, and the death of her friend weighed heavily on her. She resigned and boarded a ship straight to [Curkip](../Locations/Settlements/Curkip.md).

She thought that she would only use her strength for peace: it would be her way from now on. If peace is an option, she would always go that way.

[Noah](Noah%20Skie.md) was thinking of going home, but she thought that she had no face to show to her father. Going back home will just prove to her father that he was right: [Noah](Noah%20Skie.md) was useless all along. She went to the tavern to think how to go about things. And then she met a bunch of individuals that she felt were bound to her fate.
