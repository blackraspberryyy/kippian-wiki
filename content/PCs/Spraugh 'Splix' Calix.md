>Dear [Fiamil](../../Fiamil%20Underwood.md),
>
>Let me tell you my story. But, before we go to that, it’s only fitting to tell you where I came from, right? Well here it goes.
>
>My father used to be a human merchant residing at the outskirts of [Midkip](../Locations/Settlements/Midkip.md). He worked perseveringly, not only there, mind you, but also to numerous places, sometimes even across the [Elven Kingdom of Ephelus](../Locations/Kingdoms/Elven%20Kingdom%20of%20Ephelus.md). My father, along with his kin, served as a humble farmer for a local lord. He once pondered what it would be like seeing different landscapes, crossing mountainous borders, resting at secluded forest groves and the like, and so, he dreamt of becoming a travelling merchant. He had an interest in spellcasting and had observed the elves, mimicking their hand gestures and incantations, but to no avail. He had no teacher and not a bit of magic in his body (Curse [Miledu](../../Miledu.md)!). It was okay for him, however, since it was not the only passion he had: he also loves farming and, eventually, being a merchant.
>
>After a bit of hard work, and with the help of his siblings, he was able to buy fertile land in the eastern region just outside of [Midkip](../Locations/Settlements/Midkip.md). Near the river waters that meet the [Bay of Freezewind](../Locations/Areas/Bay%20of%20Freezewind.md), he cultivated the rich land and brought upon a farm that he thought he could make a living from. He was selling basic farm goods such as carrots, onions, and cabbages, then expanding to livestock goods and, before you know it, he became the sought-after farm goods merchant in the area. As his estate expanded, he hired farmers and merchants that he could trust. He then traveled from town to town, even across borders, in order to seek advantageous deals and to set up stalls for his merchants. Still, he lived as if he was still a humble farmer. 
>
>With all the accumulated wealth he had, my father felt it was time for the next step: building a legacy. He served his fellow townspeople and donated money to upstanding institutions. But it was not enough for him. It felt artificial, in a way. It soon became apparent to him that he should start to build a family. Well that is what he tells me.
>
>And then he found my mother (this part is going to be a bit romantic, but please endure).  Once, he found himself in the northeast city of [Ephelus](../Locations/Kingdoms/Elven%20Kingdom%20of%20Ephelus.md), [Vaiarshe](../Locations/Settlements/Vaiarshe.md), dropping goods to his buyer. There were a lot of goods that he had to bring and so he rented a space from a ship to transport his produce. Now I will transcribe from my father’s diary what is possibly the most unromantic lovers’ first meeting:
>
>*“After a lengthy span of time of traveling across the sea that made me seasick, my workers took off the supplies from the ship and put those in a big pile alongside the dock. And while my workers were doing their job unloading the goods, there was this Elven woman who noticed my seasickness not so far from the dock. She walked towards me, maybe thinking that I was the captain of the ship. She started having a conversation with me. Then I thought to myself she was just looking to buy farm goods that I might have in stock, but instead she asked inquisitively on what I had seen on my way down there, every bit of detail that I knew and could give to her. I was flustered. After a few talks and chuckles and some questions of my own, I deduced what her job was: she is a researcher. She was investigating the history of the bays and shores of [Northern Soliven](../Locations/Areas/Northern%20Soliven.md) and was in joy after knowing that the ship I was on took that path. I too was in joy: this pretty wide-eyed elf chose to speak with me instead of my more handsome co-passengers...”*
>
>He told me many more anecdotes about what happened then and the days after that. He always felt like talking to the wide-eyed Elven woman. Slowly yet willingly, he immediately thought that that elven beauty was the person he had wanted to raise a family with. She really was a lovely woman, and I attest to that.
>
>My soon-to-be mother loves nature and that absolutely made her fall in love more with my father, who was firstly a farmer. She worked with her colleagues cooperatively; and as same as my father, she has a kind attitude towards others and in fact was well known for that. She was from a middle-class family and had a desire to be in a wealthy space to continue her research, which is perfect for my father who had riches to spare. After that fateful meeting he intentionally visited [Vaiarshe](../Locations/Settlements/Vaiarshe.md) regularly not only to sell his goods but also to meet and spend time with her. They eventually married each other and lived down south of the [Elven Kingdom](../Locations/Kingdoms/Elven%20Kingdom%20of%20Ephelus.md), [Effil](../Locations/Settlements/Effil.md), where they started raising their own family. Why here? Well, they said that they wanted to get away from their familial ties, but mostly I think that they just wanted to start a new life for themselves. My father sold his farm in [Midkip](../Locations/Settlements/Midkip.md) to one of his merchants, but it’s not like my father needed more money, right? Then, they had me as their son. Oh, if I had not stated earlier, my father’s name is [Steckun Calix](../../Steckun%20Calix.md), and my mother’s is [Adzana Furwish](../../Adzana%20Furwish.md). Yes, they are my parents. I’m pretty lucky, right?
>
>*Hail to [Savras](../Deities/New%20Gods/Savras.md)!*
>
>From your ever-friend, 
>**[Splix](Spraugh%20'Splix'%20Calix.md)**
>
>P. S. More letters to come. I have an errand to do and the messenger has come to pick up the letter. See ya!

>[!note] Second Letter to [Fiamil](../../Fiamil%20Underwood.md)
>Sporcester Alley, [Effil](../Locations/Settlements/Effil.md)
>
>Cappodon, the 19th
>
>Of the year 1078
><br>
>Dearest [Fiamil](../../Fiamil%20Underwood.md),
>
>I hope you received this letter and the previous letter in quick succession. The last one’s a little bit of a cliffhanger, eh?
>
>Anyway, to continue my story (or rather, [Steckun](../../Steckun%20Calix.md)’s story), my father insisted on having a new farm in the riverbanks of [Effil](../Locations/Settlements/Effil.md) so he can continue being a merchant, albeit now for pastime (and to gain a little more wealth). My mother also retained her job. She works far away from home at times to investigate remote places as usual, though most of the time she works in our home, writing incessantly about her travels.
>
>And that’s the current situation of my family right now. But enough about them: now I’ll tell you the reason for entering the university. 
>
>Growing up, we had an elven visitor that was an expert at spellcasting. My father, intrigued and still curious about magic, implored the man to teach him some spells. The visitor, however, had his attention mostly on me. He did not talk to me however. The wizard shortly went away, leaving my father discontented.
>
>A few years later, to our surprise, the mysterious mage showed up. He and my parents had a private talk and, when they emerged, they told me that in a few years, I would enter the [Savras University](../Locations/Buildings/Savras%20University.md) at a town near [Effil](../Locations/Settlements/Effil.md). I was told to learn divination magic there, the specialty of the university.
>
>I was not prepared to learn magic, but…
>
>Look, this may seem unnatural, but please bear with me. I have been having recurring dreams. In these dreams I had allies whose faces were blurred. However, what was vivid to me was that we were fighting a dragon… with multiple heads. Every dream I cast an offensive spell (a different spell every dream) against the creature but, every time, the dragon survives. The monster then delivered a devastating attack against us. One by one my friends fell, until I was the last surviving member of the party, leaving me to face what was left of the attack. As soon as I am about to be hit, I wake up.
>
>Now I don’t believe that I was going to be a powerful mage, but the dreams made me curious, and, soon enough, I had my father’s inclination towards learning spells. I was mimicking the elves’ movements and speech, hoping that I would get that spark. I am half-elf after all, unlike my father. Well, I felt I had it in me, but I had no teacher at the time. I could not wait to enter the university.
>
>The time finally came and I entered [Savras University](../Locations/Buildings/Savras%20University.md). That is when reality finally hit. I rediscovered that I was only a half-elf, and, as such, had “lesser” magic than the “pure-blood” elves I studied with. ([Savras](../Deities/New%20Gods/Savras.md) is an exception. He was a human touched by [Akenatun](../Deities/Old%20Gods/Akenatun.md). That, my friend, is a different case altogether.) I would always find myself ranked at the bottom half of the class, except in my divination classes where I had a better grasp of the material, or rather, the immaterial.
>
>For the first 2 years in the university I was barely hanging on to my studies. My colleagues graduated while I can only create measly fire out of thin air. Very basic stuff, I know. I was considering dropping out of the university when I met my mentor, [Dorfir Embersense](../../Dorfir%20Embersense.md), and soon after, you, dear [Fiamil](../../Fiamil%20Underwood.md). This was also the moment I became more religious towards [Savras](../Deities/New%20Gods/Savras.md). He was the university’s patron, after all. 
>
>Anyway, that’s the story of my life so far. I wouldn’t mind hearing from you soon!
>
>*Hail to [Savras](../Deities/New%20Gods/Savras.md)!*

>From your ever-friend,

>[!note] Third Letter to [Fiamil](../../Fiamil%20Underwood.md)
>Sporcester Alley, [Effil](../Locations/Settlements/Effil.md)
>
>Bastordyl, the 27th
>
>Of the year 1083
><br>
>To [Fiamil](../../Fiamil%20Underwood.md),
>
>I have terrible news: I have no home now. 
>
>I went back to [Effil](../Locations/Settlements/Effil.md) on our break. The ride home was pleasant as the weather was unusually warm due to a clear sky. However, because of that clear weather, I immediately spotted a stack of smoke coming from my father’s estate. I felt my gut ache - it usually is a bad sign. I implored the coachman to hurry and he obeyed. And my worst fear came: it was our family house that was burning.
>
>I jumped out of the carriage and hurried to the door. The mansion that I call home was now engulfed in explosive flames. My instinct overcame my sense of survival and so I went inside to rescue my parents, who I knew were there since they expect me to be returning soon. 
>
>I lunged through the open doorway and right to the living room. The room was partially burning but the smoke had already filled the room. I pried open the windows to get some air and to my horror, saw the mysterious wizard that pushed me into [Savras University](../Locations/Buildings/Savras%20University.md) casting fireball towards the upper balcony. I was about to yell stop but a voice in me told me to sneak up to him so I could blast him with my spells. A petty revenge, but also it felt justifiable. And so I did. I stealthily got behind him and then when I was in range I casted a thunderwave spell. The wizard was blasted through the flaming walls of the house; then the ceiling crumbled and crushed him. I sat down in horror when it dawned on me that I had just killed someone.
>
>But it was not the time to be in shock. I collected myself and tried to reenter the house but… I was not able to as the flames were too powerful that the hot air emanating from the inside of the house was enough to burn my skin. I tried to ask for help but the estate was far from the city center. Even if I could fly I would have been too late. I could not do anything but wait.
>
>I waited for hours until all that was left of the house was charred remains. By then some friends of my parents came to comfort me. Two indistinguishable charred remains, purportedly from my parents, and the body of the wizard was taken out of the ravaged mansion. I looked at them and I identified them as such.
>
>My parents were given proper burial, fitting for nobles. They were blessed with the fire of [Akenatun](../Deities/Old%20Gods/Akenatun.md) and the ashes were kept in the city’s [Matunda](../Deities/Old%20Gods/Matunda.md) urn.
>
>I appraised and sold all the property and valuables my parents had. I only kept personal trinkets. There was nothing left for me in [Effil](../Locations/Settlements/Effil.md) so I left town and headed to the university. There I gathered all my belongings and sold the unnecessary stuff.
>
>Now here I am writing this letter on the desk in our room. I am pondering on what to do with my life now. I was initially thinking of continuing to study but the pain that a knowledgeable wizard killed my family was much to bear. It made me think that the university might be harboring vile individuals such as the mysterious mage. I could not do it.
>
>And so I am left with the choice to leave the university. In truth I am inclined to find my luck in the [United Kippian](../Locations/Kingdoms/Kingdom%20of%20United%20Kippian.md). I am a Calix after all, I belong in that kingdom too. I just hope that it would be as good to me as it had been with my father.
>
>Thank you for being a good friend all these years. I hope to see you someday, as you are the only family I have left.
>
>*Hail to [Savras](../Deities/New%20Gods/Savras.md).*
