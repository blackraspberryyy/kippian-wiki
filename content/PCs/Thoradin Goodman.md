##### Known for: being a staunch paladin of [Macchi](../Deities/New%20Gods/Macchi.md)
### Description
#### Class: Paladin
#### Subclass: [Oath of the Shield](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Oath_of_the_Shield_(5e_Subclass))
#### Backstory
Thoradin Goodman grew up in [Onix](../Locations/Settlements/Onix.md), a small mountain village near the [Opidian](../Locations/Kingdoms/Opidys.md) city of [Qwartz](../Locations/Settlements/Qwartz.md). The region was believed to be the place where the [Age of Orcs](../Events/Age%20of%20Orcs.md) started. Thus, followers of [Macchi](../Deities/New%20Gods/Macchi.md) settled here in case new [Kortusk](../Deities/New%20Gods/Kortusk.md) orcs began spawning. The legend passed from generations to generations, and the followers of Macchi dwindled; however, some of them stayed loyal, as was the case of Thoradin’s lineage. Thorvald Goodman, Thoradin’s father, is a devout paladin dedicated to Macchi. Seris Goodman, his mother, on the other hand, is an oracle and a herald for the same god.

> [!note] ##### [The Corruption of Kortusk](../Lore/The%20Corruption%20of%20Kortusk.md)
>_“It was said that in ancient times, at the end of the [Age of Beasts](../Events/Age%20of%20Beasts.md), Miledu deceived and corrupted [Kortusk](../Deities/New%20Gods/Kortusk.md), son of the orc god [Macchi](../Deities/New%20Gods/Macchi.md). [Kortusk](../Deities/New%20Gods/Kortusk.md), believing that his brother [Gorbogi](../Deities/New%20Gods/Gorbogi.md) was trying to usurp their father, killed him in his sleep. This grave offense was not tolerated by the gods, and thus, [Akenatun](../Deities/Old%20Gods/Akenatun.md), the sun-god, the all-creator, banished [Macchi](../Deities/New%20Gods/Macchi.md) to guard the underground prison of Miledu as penance for his son’s actions. [Macchi](../Deities/New%20Gods/Macchi.md) was then expelled from the [Pantheon of the Old Gods](../Deities/Old%20Gods/Pantheon%20of%20the%20Old%20Gods.md)._
>
>_A worse fate awaited [Kortusk](../Deities/New%20Gods/Kortusk.md) and his brood. [Kortusk](../Deities/New%20Gods/Kortusk.md)’s body and soul was severed from the other. His body was cursed to never decay, and was locked and buried deep underground, never to be found again. His soul was fractured and was forced to invade the souls of his descendants. [Kortusk](../Deities/New%20Gods/Kortusk.md), consumed by hatred, tormented his followers to destroy every other living being until they died. Such was the curse of [Kortusk](../Deities/New%20Gods/Kortusk.md)’s progeny. [The Old Gods](../Deities/Old%20Gods/Pantheon%20of%20the%20Old%20Gods.md) believed that that would be the end of [Kortusk](../Deities/New%20Gods/Kortusk.md) and his evil deeds._
>
>_Miledu, however, anticipated the plan. He had planted a cursed seed inside [Kortusk](../Deities/New%20Gods/Kortusk.md)’s body before his demise. The seed consumed the body, transforming the non-decaying matter to lifeless orc vessels. When the last of the old progeny of [Kortusk](../Deities/New%20Gods/Kortusk.md) perished, the fractured souls of the fallen god bound to the fully-formed orcs inside the cursed body. These new [Kortusk](../Deities/New%20Gods/Kortusk.md) orcs were born with such hatred and destruction, and nothing else. After some time, they finally surfaced and began to ravage the once peaceful land._
>
>_And thus began the [Age of Orcs](../Events/Age%20of%20Orcs.md).”_

The Goodman family is respected in the village; they even elected Thorvald Goodman to be the village leader in times of crises. Such crises came in the form of raids from rabid [Kortusk fanatics](../Factions/Kortusk%20Orcs.md). As fervent followers of [Macchi](../Deities/New%20Gods/Macchi.md), Thorvald Goodman and the villagers vowed to stamp out this evil from whence they came. While now not as powerful as the [the Old Gods](../Deities/Old%20Gods/Pantheon%20of%20the%20Old%20Gods.md), [Macchi](../Deities/New%20Gods/Macchi.md) still uses his divine power to guide his followers to fight [Kortusk](../Deities/New%20Gods/Kortusk.md).

[Thoradin](Thoradin%20Goodman.md) knew that his path in life is to follow the footsteps of his father and be a servant of [Macchi](../Deities/New%20Gods/Macchi.md). Since his early childhood, he had always dreamt of becoming a paladin to protect the villagers from the vile fanatics.

[Thoradin](Thoradin%20Goodman.md), however, was not alone in pursuing this dream. His childhood friend, Elix Claymore, also dreams of becoming a paladin of Macchi. This was not surprising since their fathers, Thorvald Goodman and Alexis Claymore, were great friends and were both paladins. They fought side by side, and together they were unstoppable. [Thoradin](Thoradin%20Goodman.md) and Elix Claymore would always hear the stories of their fathers’ adventures, and they both hoped to be the main characters in their own stories someday.

One fateful day, however, Thorvald Goodman arrived at the village without Alexis Claymore, who was with him when they started an offensive of their own against the [cult of Kortusk](../Factions/Kortusk%20Orcs.md). Elix Claymore’s father died on the mission, and Thorvald Goodman delivered this heartbreaking news to Elix Claymore. Thorvald Goodman did not hesitate to be the guardian of Elix Claymore. Elix Claymore, whose mother had died several years ago, accepted the offer, with some nudging from [Thoradin](Thoradin%20Goodman.md). 

After a few weeks, a strange human claiming to be an older brother of Alexis Claymore arrived to get Elix Claymore. Even though the Goodmans didn’t want to let Elix Claymore go, they cannot do so as the man provided documents, signed by both Alexis and his wife, that substantiates his claim as the new guardian of Elix Claymore. The mysterious man took Elix Claymore away, and [Thoradin](Thoradin%20Goodman.md) never saw him since.

Years later, [Thoradin](Thoradin%20Goodman.md) trained enough to go on a mission as a novice. [Thoradin](Thoradin%20Goodman.md) was assigned to support a group of soldiers assaulting a [Kortusk](../Deities/New%20Gods/Kortusk.md) party. During the fight, [Thoradin](Thoradin%20Goodman.md) caught a glimpse of a hooded caster close to his position. Looking at the lay of the land, [Thoradin](Thoradin%20Goodman.md) noticed that the caster had an overwhelming vision of the battlefield and thus could ravage the party of Macchians if he casted an offensive spell. [Thoradin](Thoradin%20Goodman.md) bolted and ran into him and pinned the surprised human to the ground. [Thoradin](Thoradin%20Goodman.md) then lifted the draping hood to reveal the enemy’s face. To his surprise, the mage was not even an adult. The youth looked afraid and disoriented.

Driven by guilt of assaulting a child, instead of restraining the kid, [Thoradin](Thoradin%20Goodman.md) told him to go as far away as he can from the opposing parties. [Thoradin](Thoradin%20Goodman.md) lets the kid go; hoping that he permanently leaves the ranks of his party’s enemies. [Thoradin](Thoradin%20Goodman.md) then went back to his group and healed the wounded soldiers. A few reinforcements came from [Thoradin](Thoradin%20Goodman.md)’s side, and the battle favored heavily against the [Kortusk followers](../Factions/Kortusk%20Orcs.md). The enemies retreated and [Thoradin](Thoradin%20Goodman.md)’s group started celebrating and hugging each other. Then, seemingly appearing out of nowhere, a shadowed figure showed up on the top of the hill closest to them and casted a powerful lightning bolt directed to the group. The attack immediately killed two of his kin and wounded three others. The party’s mage cast a powerful fireball to the attacker, who was not moving and was just staring down at them. The fireball illuminated the enemy for a split second, but it was enough for [Thoradin](Thoradin%20Goodman.md) to recognize who it was: it was the kid he had saved earlier. [Thoradin](Thoradin%20Goodman.md) felt sick to his stomach. 

Somehow, even if they were enemies and had met for just a few moments, [Thoradin](Thoradin%20Goodman.md) felt a little connection to the kid, the same he had when he was with Elix Claymore. Somehow he knew that the two were connected. However, whatever that connection was, he will never know as the kid laid dead, as cold as the water found deep in the [Lake of Shimmers](../Locations/Areas/Lake%20of%20Shimmers.md).

The grim scene left [Thoradin](Thoradin%20Goodman.md) with enormous guilt. The deaths of his companions were his, but so was the kid’s life. Ashamed to go back to [Onix](../Locations/Settlements/Onix.md), [Thoradin](Thoradin%20Goodman.md) left [Opidian](../Locations/Kingdoms/Opidys.md) and ended up in a tavern in the bustling town of [Curkip](../Locations/Settlements/Curkip.md). In that southern human city, [Thoradin](Thoradin%20Goodman.md) hopes to absolve himself from remorse and to find answers on why the blood feud between the Macchians and Kortusks, which had cost many innocent lives, persists to this day.
