## Backstory

The very first memory that [Adikia Unalome](Adikia%20Unalome.md) still remembers was the bustling streets of [Vaiarshe](../Locations/Settlements/Vaiarshe.md). With it are the hard facts of her life: wearing a crappy shirt with holes that are awful to wear during extreme weathers, stealing food from both the vendors and their customers, and living in a small box she called home. [Adikia](Adikia%20Unalome.md) never knew her heritage and it did not matter to her; all she minds is her survival. During her pastimes, however, she developed a knack for music, a talent which she used to earn coins from entertained elves.

Her talent was noticed by two good-natured elves who run an inn in [Vaiarshe](../Locations/Settlements/Vaiarshe.md). At first [Adikia](Adikia%20Unalome.md) rebuffed the gratitude given to her unconditionally but she eventually cave in. [Idril](../../Idril%20Bluedrin.md) and [Poldo Bluedrin](../../Poldo%20Bluedrin.md) took her in, clothed her and gave her a bed to sleep on. The old couple also gave her a job initially as a cleaner, but when they discovered her enchanting play of the lute they asked her to play for the customers of the inn. She practiced and learned new songs. In her free time she held street performances that were on par with the visiting musicians and poets and playmakers. “She is meant to be a bard,” a crowd would cheer at one of her performances. She became a local attraction in an instant and drew an audience whenever and wherever she performed.

[Adikia](Adikia%20Unalome.md)’s mood swings were changing like the weather, and at times it seemed literal. On hot summer days she is mostly hotheaded; during autumn she becomes a bit generous; winter nights bore her to no end; and on spring days she is as jolly as a crazed follower of [Faif](../Deities/New%20Gods/Faif.md). 

Through the years her greed and indifference got the better of her and she started having arguments with some of the inn’s customers and her street audience. There were several things: accusations of thieving which were not baseless, arrogant remarks that resulted in verbal contests, weekly fistfights, and even the occasional duels. In fact, there once was a murder allegation against [Adikia](Adikia%20Unalome.md). She and an elf who mocked her fought in a duel, according to some shady witnesses. [Adikia](Adikia%20Unalome.md) kept her mouth shut while [Idril](../../Idril%20Bluedrin.md) and [Poldo](../../Poldo%20Bluedrin.md) backed her and gave positive testimony. It was overturned mostly due to a lack of evidence, but the mysterious disappearance of the other duelist did not help [Adikia](Adikia%20Unalome.md) in rehabilitating her reputation.

Years go by and [Adikia](Adikia%20Unalome.md)’s popularity faded substantially. Her earnings were reduced too as she mainly performed only at the inn. [Idril](../../Idril%20Bluedrin.md) and [Poldo](../../Poldo%20Bluedrin.md) were still supportive of her and, fitting for a daughter, provided her with a small yet hospitable dwelling near the couple. On her 18th birthday (that is, on the 18th year after the day the couple had found her), the Bluedrins gifted her an ornately designed violin, designed and built by an elven woodsmith. The violin, which she named “Vionna”, became [Adikia](Adikia%20Unalome.md)’s most prized possession.

As a gift to herself, she asked the old couple to allow her to travel for a while. The Bluedrins eventually relented and [Adikia](Adikia%20Unalome.md) toured [Ephelus](../Locations/Kingdoms/Elven%20Kingdom%20of%20Ephelus.md). She performed at the towns and cities and the crowd received her mightily, as her prowess with her violin became more polished and more charming. Her visual appearance also helped [Adikia](Adikia%20Unalome.md) to stand out from the mostly elvish throngs: her slender limbs and youthful color added to her already exquisite performance. There still was a bit of misconduct here and there, but it was mostly ignored as she was gone the following day. Her fame in the areas she visited sharply rose and harshly fell as the waves on the [Bay of Lostwind](../Locations/Areas/Bay%20of%20Lostwind.md).

A year and a half passed and [Adikia](Adikia%20Unalome.md) longed for the Bluedrins. Excited about the new pieces of tunes she wrote, [Adikia](Adikia%20Unalome.md) wanted the couple to hear her play the violin. As the inn was within eyeshot, [Adikia](Adikia%20Unalome.md) sensed something wrong. At that moment [Adikia](Adikia%20Unalome.md) recognized a fear she had not known: the death of her adoptive parents. The inn had been ravaged and looted just recently and it left Adikia no choice but to step in and hope that [Idril](../../Idril%20Bluedrin.md) and [Poldo](../../Poldo%20Bluedrin.md) were still alive. She entered through the windows and through the rubble of broken glass and disarranged chairs and tables [Adikia](Adikia%20Unalome.md) noticed a scoundrel pilfering for valuables on the opposite side of the room. [Adikia](Adikia%20Unalome.md)’s rage bubbled and she chanted a verse she never knew. A misty haze covered her then, in the blink of an eye, she was thrusting a rapier through the frightened elf. With no remorse, she looked at him with bitter eyes and let him bleed out.

[Adikia](Adikia%20Unalome.md) soon found the cold body of her parents. The large window pane in the backroom of the inn was broken from inside out; and the chilly winter wind penetrated the small room and froze the two dead bodies clinging to each other. [Adikia](Adikia%20Unalome.md) felt shame and regret that she was not here to protect them. 

Nearby, the wall was laden with strange yet familiar inscriptions. She took note of them and read it:

>The winterborn of [Corleus](../../Corleus.md) is always at war
>
>with the summerborn of [Soliven](../Locations/Areas/Soliven.md).
>
>You should never feel safe
>
>in this realm that you escaped to.
>
>You cannot hide forever in the light, princess.

[Adikia](Adikia%20Unalome.md) could not recognize for whom the message, but she intuited that it was for her. “Winterborn, summerborn…”, these words describe the race of [The Eladrin](../Factions/The%20Eladrin.md), a near mythical house of elves that were believed to be extinct and only resided in myths and songs that [Adikia](Adikia%20Unalome.md) regularly plays. When she considered her newfound power, her slightly different stature and color with respect to the Ephelian elves, she pondered: was she from the famed elven race of the [The Eladrin](../Factions/The%20Eladrin.md), the descendants of the goddess [Ela](../Deities/New%20Gods/Ela.md)? If that is so, could it be that she really is a princess? Or is this all a case of mistaken identity, many of such instances have happened to her before?

There was no time to think as she heard the local guards traversing the snow, closing in on the inn. [Adikia](Adikia%20Unalome.md) gave her parents one last kiss, bolted out of the inn through the broken window and was never seen again in [Vaiarshe](../Locations/Settlements/Vaiarshe.md).

[Adikia](Adikia%20Unalome.md) vowed to learn more about herself and her lineage, and to avenge the death of her parents, both of which took the same path. Like the subject of the bardic myths from [Azir](../Lore/Mythical%20Heroes/Azir%20Kyp.md), an Ephelian hero, [Adikia](Adikia%20Unalome.md) trusted fate to lead her to her goals. Days later, from a sustenance of cheap wine and even cheaper rations, [Adikia](Adikia%20Unalome.md) found herself on the southern outskirts of the [United Kippian](../Locations/Kingdoms/Kingdom%20of%20United%20Kippian.md). Fate has guided [Adikia](Adikia%20Unalome.md) to this place and, as celebration for her new life mission, she decided to take a sip of good wine at [Richie's Tavern](../Locations/Buildings/Richie's%20Inn%20and%20Rentals.md).

But if her soul has wandered far, Beyond the meadows of breath and pulse… Then, O [Matunda](Matunda.md)—keeper of the stillness, Guide of roots, womb of endings— I do not defy you. I ask only this: Lend your ear to the plea of a friend, Who cannot bear the silence she left behind.” “Between life and death, I stand— Not to conquer either, But to honor both. “By [Aisef](Aisef.md)’s mercy… By [Matunda](Matunda.md)’s wisdom… And by the bonds not even death could cut— [Adikia](Adikia%20Unalome.md)… Come home.”*
