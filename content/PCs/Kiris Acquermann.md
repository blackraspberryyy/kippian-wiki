## Description
### Class: Sorcerer
### Subclass: [Shadow Magic Sorcerer](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/sorcerer:shadow-magic)
## Backstory
A half orc in search of his lineage. [Kiris](Kiris%20Acquermann.md) was raised by his mother, [Sera](../../Sera.md), in a cursed and secluded place: the cold wilderness of [Lazagog's Forest](../Locations/Areas/Lazagog's%20Forest.md). Growing up, he discovered that he has this untapped magic ability within him. [Kiris](Kiris%20Acquermann.md) tried to control it himself, but to no avail. He can cast basic spells, sure, but he knows that there is much, much more to this uncanny skill; even so for an orc.

And he was an orc, for a time. As he grew older, he began to notice features that resembled a human rather than an orc: smoother skin, lighter pigmentation, smaller set of tusks, and a preference for cooked food. But [Kiris](Kiris%20Acquermann.md) is not only a half-orc; he is a magic-wielding half-orc. He intuits that maybe that is the reason her mother and him lived away from orc tribes: to conceal her peculiar son.

All the time [Kiris](Kiris%20Acquermann.md) spent in the forest with his mother made him wonder about his father’s identity. His eagerness to know the truth gave him negative emotions; he even thought that his father hated him, and they were banished to the forest because of his mixed race. His secretive mother always dismissed his questions about his father. But it did nothing to sweep his emotions away. Someday, he will learn his father’s secrets.

Time went on, and [Sera](../../Sera.md) became severely ill. [Kiris](Kiris%20Acquermann.md)’ magic, while becoming more powerful, was not able to heal. And since they were miles from known orc healers, Sera eventually died a slow yet peaceful death. She died holding [Kiris](Kiris%20Acquermann.md)’ hand. On her other hand, however, was a box [Kiris](Kiris%20Acquermann.md) had never seen before. The box proved to be the starting point of the young orc’s adventure.

The box contained a curious emblem, 10 gold pieces, and a note from [Sera](../../Sera.md). The letter warned him that knowing the truth of his father’s identity will just bring him harm. However, knowing that [Kiris](Kiris%20Acquermann.md) would just ignore her warning and would continue to find the truth anyway, she wrote him something that may help him: first, that his name is based on his father’s name; and second, that the emblem that is included in the box is his inheritance from his father.

The contents of the box left [Kiris](Kiris%20Acquermann.md) with more questions than answers, yet he felt closer to the truth. It was now up to him to begin his quest on knowing his lineage and identity, a journey that started from the deep wilds of [Lazagog's Forest](../Locations/Areas/Lazagog's%20Forest.md) to a comfortable tavern in [Curkip](../Locations/Settlements/Curkip.md).
