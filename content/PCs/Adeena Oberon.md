## Backstory
>[!note] [The Legend of Yekora and Aulephi](../Lore/The%20Legend%20of%20Yekora%20and%20Aulephi.md)
>There was a time when all elves lived in harmony. This was during the [Age of the New Gods](../Lore/Eons%20and%20Ages/Age%20of%20the%20New%20Gods.md), when smaller deities were being added to the [Pantheon of the Lesser Gods](../Deities/New%20Gods/Pantheon%20of%20the%20Lesser%20Gods.md). The elves, descendants of the great god [Corlion](../Deities/Old%20Gods/Corlion.md), by that time, had hoisted and followed these elven gods: [Aisef](../Deities/New%20Gods/Aisef.md) and [Fesai](../Deities/New%20Gods/Fesai.md), twin gods of healing and poison, respectively; [Ela](../Deities/New%20Gods/Ela.md), the goddess of beauty and the progenitor of the [Eladrins](../Factions/The%20Eladrin.md); and [Amlin](../Deities/New%20Gods/Amlin.md), the goddess of magic. The elves had a majority on the pantheon of lesser gods, but their power was weakening due to a decrease in worship.
>
>There were two ways to worship the elven gods. One was to pray in communion with other believers, and the other was to pray in solitude. The former method of worship dedicates to the lesser elven gods by invoking [Corlion](../Deities/Old%20Gods/Corlion.md); the followers of the latter method devotes to [Antasha](../Deities/Old%20Gods/Antasha.md), the great goddess of land and its inhabitants, as they would always pray in the presence of secluded holy groves designated by the god. Now the two great gods need not quarrel over this, but the lesser gods had a discourse. There needed to be one method of worship, but on what method to choose they had arguments. [Aisef](../Deities/New%20Gods/Aisef.md) and [Ela](../Deities/New%20Gods/Ela.md) preferred communion, while [Fesai](../Deities/New%20Gods/Fesai.md) and [Amlin](../Deities/New%20Gods/Amlin.md) wished for solitary worship.
>
>On the mortal plane, the two beliefs were represented by the high elves and the wood elves. The high elves were more attuned to communion, while the wood elves were innately solitary and as such, became naturally attached in the other method. Due to their differences not only in worship but also in way of life and worldly beliefs, the two sides readied for war. The lesser gods were involved too, and they were ready to use their power and following to tip the scales of war.
>
>As the two factions were closing in on the tipping point, the council of the great gods intervened. They decided that the two factions, instead of pursuing war, should choose among them a champion for their cause. The two champions would fight under the supervision of the great gods. The faction represented by the defeated champion should concede their belief and must accept the method of worship of the other faction. The lesser gods were allowed to aid the champions with reserved limitations.
>
>The arena on [Iselia](../Locations/Settlements/Iselia.md) was set and the chosen champions, [Yekora](../Deities/New%20Gods/Yekora.md) and [Aulephi](../Deities/New%20Gods/Aulephi.md), entered the arena. [Yekora](../Deities/New%20Gods/Yekora.md), who fervently believed in communion, was a popular and powerful high elf. [Aulephi](../Deities/New%20Gods/Aulephi.md), who believed in solitary worship, was the leader of the wood elves. However, the two were not exceptional fighters: but they were gifted spellcasters. In fact, it was said that the two champions had been actually surveilling the other for several weeks before the duel, and as such prepared offensive and defensive spells catered to the strengths and weaknesses of their opponents. The duel would later be known as the origin of the spellcasting duels or mage contests prominent in the elven kingdoms.
>
>The lesser gods were not allowed to direct their champions at the moment of the battle. Due to this, the four elven gods helped their champions to prepare for the battle. [Aisef](../Deities/New%20Gods/Aisef.md) blessed [Yekora](../Deities/New%20Gods/Yekora.md) before the day of the fight, but [Fesai](../Deities/New%20Gods/Fesai.md) knew this and had enchanted Aulephi’s spells to counter [Aisef](../Deities/New%20Gods/Aisef.md)’s blessing. [Ela](../Deities/New%20Gods/Ela.md) on the other hand had charmed followers of [Aulephi](../Deities/New%20Gods/Aulephi.md) to gather information about her spells and battle tactics, while [Amlin](../Deities/New%20Gods/Amlin.md) studied [Yekora](../Deities/New%20Gods/Yekora.md)’s spells and pinpointed to [Aulephi](../Deities/New%20Gods/Aulephi.md) about her weaknesses.
>
>The anticipated battle started in the year 3086 of the [Eon of Akenatun's Descent](../Lore/Eons%20and%20Ages/Eon%20of%20Akenatun's%20Descent.md) (EAD). The two fought with grace and skill rivaling the gods. Each spell was countered by the opponent’s defensive spell, and both the gods and the mortal audience were enthralled. [Akenatun](../Deities/Old%20Gods/Akenatun.md) was impressed by the spectacle that the sun lit up until the duel finished. After a day of intense battle-casting, it was apparent that the two were equally matched. However, due to the relentless flow of spells, magic was sapped from both of them. The efforts of the lesser gods have been countered and neutralized by the gods on the other side. The champions, still equally matched, would have to resort to the usual hand-to-hand combat.
>
>Even though they were not excellent fighters, [Yekora](../Deities/New%20Gods/Yekora.md) and [Aulephi](../Deities/New%20Gods/Aulephi.md) were still proficient with weapons. [Yekora](../Deities/New%20Gods/Yekora.md) handled the sword well, while [Aulephi](../Deities/New%20Gods/Aulephi.md) knew the ways of the bow and daggers. As their use of magic depleted, their dependence on their weapons grew. [Yekora](../Deities/New%20Gods/Yekora.md) charged with her sword but [Aulephi](../Deities/New%20Gods/Aulephi.md) kept her distance as she blocked her attacks with her daggers. This continued for hours and their stamina dwindled. It was said that some of the audience passed out due to exhaustion. [Yekora](../Deities/New%20Gods/Yekora.md), after continuously chasing her elusive foe, finally managed to strike a devastating blow; but [Aulephi](../Deities/New%20Gods/Aulephi.md), while gasping for her last breath, countered with her dagger before eventually dying from the strike. It had appeared that [Yekora](../Deities/New%20Gods/Yekora.md) won but, on her way out of the arena, she dropped and began coughing out blood. The elven adjudicator ran to [Yekora](../Deities/New%20Gods/Yekora.md) to aid her but it was too late. [Yekora](../Deities/New%20Gods/Yekora.md) lost too much blood and died on the battlefield.
>
>With no clear winner, it was up to the council of the great gods to decide. [Yekora](../Deities/New%20Gods/Yekora.md) did outlast [Aulephi](../Deities/New%20Gods/Aulephi.md), but it was clearly stated in the rules that whoever exited the arena alive would be considered as the winner. A lengthy discussion with the [The Lesser Gods](../Deities/New%20Gods/Pantheon%20of%20the%20Lesser%20Gods.md) proved to be futile. [Akenatun](../Deities/Old%20Gods/Akenatun.md), displeased with their conduct, thundered above them and took the matter into his own hands. He revived both [Yekora](../Deities/New%20Gods/Yekora.md) and [Aulephi](../Deities/New%20Gods/Aulephi.md); then, he elevated them to godhood. [Akenatun](../Deities/Old%20Gods/Akenatun.md), in doing this, implied to the lesser elven gods to accept both methods of worship. The lesser gods reluctantly agreed at first, but in time they accepted [Akenatun](../Deities/Old%20Gods/Akenatun.md)’s ruling.
>
>As for the mortal elves, a fracture between the two methods continued to persist, albeit diminished in intensity. Still, fervent followers of [Yekora](../Deities/New%20Gods/Yekora.md) and [Aulephi](../Deities/New%20Gods/Aulephi.md) hounded the other which resulted in minor yet bloody clashes. High elves flocked to cities while wood elves dispersed to the forests and secluded places. It was also during that time that the elves established the elven kingdoms of [Ephelus](../Locations/Kingdoms/Elven%20Kingdom%20of%20Ephelus.md) and [Corleus](../../Corleus.md). Pressure from surrounding kingdoms would eventually pit these two elven kingdoms against each other, resulting in what would be called as the [Kippian-Sumber War](../Lore/Kippian-Sumber%20War.md), a war that spanned generations and led to disastrous calamities for both sides.

[Adeena](Adeena%20Oberon.md) was orphaned and immediately adopted at the age of 5. She never knew who her parents were, and so she naturally clinged to her benefactor and adopted father, [Frederick Oberon](../../Frederick%20Oberon.md). The noble half-elf provided [Adeena](Adeena%20Oberon.md) food, shelter, security, and most importantly, an identity. [Adeena](Adeena%20Oberon.md) felt obligated to serve [Frederick](../../Frederick%20Oberon.md) in whatever way she could, and [Frederick](../../Frederick%20Oberon.md) did not think twice of using it to his advantage. After a time of teaching and conditioning [Adeena](Adeena%20Oberon.md), [Frederick](../../Frederick%20Oberon.md) realized that she has the skills to be a spy for him and his religious organization. [Adeena](Adeena%20Oberon.md) complied and became a spy accomplice of [Frederick](../../Frederick%20Oberon.md).

The main mission of the followers of [Yekora](../Deities/New%20Gods/Yekora.md) was to find and kill followers of [Aulephi](../Deities/New%20Gods/Aulephi.md). Even though the legendary battle between the two gods happened ages ago, their followers were still fervently pursuing the other faction. This was done mostly in secrecy, however. Both factions would not admit that they are from either [Yekora](../Deities/New%20Gods/Yekora.md) and [Aulephi](../Deities/New%20Gods/Aulephi.md) in fear of their rival’s actions. Both trained spies to gather information and assassins to kill their rivals.

[Adeena](Adeena%20Oberon.md) was on her first mission when she met [Cain Othburn](../../Cain%20Othburn.md). [Adeena](Adeena%20Oberon.md)’s mission was to follow him and verify whether he is a [Follower of Aulephi](../Factions/Followers%20of%20Aulephi.md). One bright morning, [Cain](../../Cain%20Othburn.md) went to a lake far from the city of [Iselia](../Locations/Settlements/Iselia.md). [Adeena](Adeena%20Oberon.md) followed him. [Cain](../../Cain%20Othburn.md) sat down near the lake and began meditating. [Adeena](Adeena%20Oberon.md) moved closer to hear his incantations. She was carefully hidden behind the bushes and so she was shocked when a man tapped her in the shoulders. “You-you’re [Cain](../../Cain%20Othburn.md)!”, [Adeena](Adeena%20Oberon.md) said with terrible fear. [Adeena](Adeena%20Oberon.md) glanced back to where she thought [Cain](../../Cain%20Othburn.md) was but there was no one there. “Fancy seeing you here. That there was an illusion. Now, why don’t you join me?” [Adeena](Adeena%20Oberon.md) initially declined but looked at his invitation as a way to get to know him better. [Cain](../../Cain%20Othburn.md)’s good looks and charm did help to sway her in agreeing.

And so they talked from morning until dusk. [Adeena](Adeena%20Oberon.md) was charmed, and she felt that [Cain](../../Cain%20Othburn.md) liked her too. When she went home to her lodging inn, she remembered that [Cain](../../Cain%20Othburn.md) is an enemy… But it did not feel like that to [Adeena](Adeena%20Oberon.md). “Maybe I can learn more from him if I talk to him more...”, [Adeena](Adeena%20Oberon.md) muttered in her sleep. And so she met [Cain](../../Cain%20Othburn.md) the following morning. Then the next morning, and the next. This continued for days, then weeks. They were content in each other’s company, and every day [Adeena](Adeena%20Oberon.md) became enamored to leave his adopted father and stay with [Cain](../../Cain%20Othburn.md).

Unbeknownst to the two, [Frederick](../../Frederick%20Oberon.md) had hired a fellow spy to follow and record [Adeena](Adeena%20Oberon.md)’s first mission. When [Frederick](../../Frederick%20Oberon.md) learned that [Adeena](Adeena%20Oberon.md) became attached to a [follower of Aulephi](../Factions/Followers%20of%20Aulephi.md), he went berserk. He hired a group of assassins under [Yekora](../Deities/New%20Gods/Yekora.md)’s service. “Do it as fast as possible. Make [Adeena](Adeena%20Oberon.md) regret her decision.”, [Frederick](../../Frederick%20Oberon.md) told the group.

Meanwhile the couple lived blissfully, unaware of things coming their way. One evening, as [Cain](../../Cain%20Othburn.md) and [Adeena](Adeena%20Oberon.md) were having an intimate conversation by the lake, an artificial rustle in the bushes behind them alerted them to unwanted company. [Cain](../../Cain%20Othburn.md) instinctively shielded [Adeena](Adeena%20Oberon.md), but it was of no use: they were surrounded. Three men held [Adeena](Adeena%20Oberon.md) and [Cain](../../Cain%20Othburn.md) was made to vow to [Yekora](../Deities/New%20Gods/Yekora.md). [Cain](../../Cain%20Othburn.md) looked at [Adeena](Adeena%20Oberon.md). He looked mournfully and, ignoring their captors, said to [Adeena](Adeena%20Oberon.md), “You led them to me? Why [Adeena](Adeena%20Oberon.md), why?” Cain looked lost and defeated. He looked up at the sky, closed his eyes and then whispered incantations.

The captors punched [Cain](../../Cain%20Othburn.md). ”Swore to [Yekora](../Deities/New%20Gods/Yekora.md) now, or else meet [Aulephi](../Deities/New%20Gods/Aulephi.md) in the world above!” said one of the assassins. “Never! I devote my life to [Aulephi](../Deities/New%20Gods/Aulephi.md)! Just kill me now and leave [Adeena](Adeena%20Oberon.md) alone!” [Cain](../../Cain%20Othburn.md) pleaded. “As you wish.”

The assassins took [Cain](../../Cain%20Othburn.md)’s lifeless body. [Adeena](Adeena%20Oberon.md), still feeling shocked and angry, was given a note by the captors:

>[!note] [Frederick](../../Frederick%20Oberon.md)'s letter to [Adeena](Adeena%20Oberon.md)
>[Adeena](Adeena%20Oberon.md),
>
>Remember that you owe your life to me. I have taught you that, haven't I? You will only worship the path that I will pave for you, and no more. Come back home in [Sumber](../Locations/Continents/Sumber.md) and we’ll discuss this matter more.

[Adeena](Adeena%20Oberon.md) felt a seething anger welling from inside her. She lashed out at the sky and cursed [Yekora](../Deities/New%20Gods/Yekora.md). She then gazed down at the lake and looked at her reflection in the water. An elven figure loomed behind her.

>[!quote|mark] [Aulephi](../Deities/New%20Gods/Aulephi.md)
>*“You are hurting, child. I can ease your pain. Hold on to what you feel, hold on to the vengeance in your heart. Revenge is what you want, I can give it to you. Follow me. I am [Aulephi](../Deities/New%20Gods/Aulephi.md) of the [Soliven](../Locations/Areas/Soliven.md), patron of the wood elves. I swear to this day that you will have your revenge against your enemies. When my figure disappears, reach beneath the water for my amulet and head for [Curkip](../Locations/Settlements/Curkip.md). There you will find six more mortals that will help you in your journey. Rise, [Adeena](Adeena%20Oberon.md), and avenge your love.”*

[Adeena](Adeena%20Oberon.md) felt a sense of calm replacing her anger. When the figure disappeared, she reached for the bottom of the lake and found a wooden amulet bearing the symbol of [Aulephi](../Deities/New%20Gods/Aulephi.md): a tree inscribed by a triangle, which was in turn inscribed by a circle.

[Adeena](Adeena%20Oberon.md) then took her possessions and told the innkeeper to say to those looking for her that she was on her way home to [Sumber](../Locations/Continents/Sumber.md). She departed secretly in the middle of the night and hurried straight to [Curkip](../Locations/Settlements/Curkip.md). 

During her stay at [Richie's Inn](../Locations/Buildings/Richie's%20Inn%20and%20Rentals.md), she met a bunch of individuals. A local leader asked for help regarding a sewer infestation and [Adeena](Adeena%20Oberon.md) and the individuals volunteered to help. The next day, [Adeena](Adeena%20Oberon.md) left the city and worshiped [Aulephi](../Deities/New%20Gods/Aulephi.md). [Adeena](Adeena%20Oberon.md) asked for a sign whether these are the people who would help her in her journey. She received the sign and acknowledged [Aulephi](../Deities/New%20Gods/Aulephi.md). [Adeena](Adeena%20Oberon.md)’s first step in avenging [Cain](../../Cain%20Othburn.md) has begun.

[Adikia](Adikia%20Unalome.md) fails; however, she figures out that the man [Adeena](Adeena%20Oberon.md) is surrendering to is [Kayriel](Kayriel%20Acquermann.md), or at least resembles its face.
- [Session 43](../Session%20Log/Session%2043.md): [Kayriel](Kayriel%20Acquermann.md) is defeated; however, it turns out that it is not the real body of [Kayriel](Kayriel%20Acquermann.md) either. The body melts again, as the illusion bids another warning.

- [Session 45](../Session%20Log/Session%2045.md): [Adeena](Adeena%20Oberon.md) is initially hesitant, but [Kayriel](Kayriel%20Acquermann.md) convinces her to trust the plan.

[Nos](Nos-Aji.md) explains that their supply is dwindling, and that he is trying to find the process of creating gloompowder.
